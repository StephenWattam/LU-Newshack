Russia has a key naval facility which it leases at the port of Tartous and has forces at the Hmeimim airbase in Latakia.</paragraph><paragraph>In September 2015, with rebel forces advancing on Latakia, Russian forces launched an air campaign which President Vladimir Putin said was aimed at \"stabilising\" the Syrian government and creating conditions for \"a political compromise\" that would end the five-year conflict.</paragraph><crosshead>What does Russia say its intervention achieved?</crosshead><paragraph>In March 2016, Mr Putin ordered the \"main part\" of Russia's forces to withdraw from Syria, saying their mission had \"on the whole\" been accomplished. </paragraph><paragraph>Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russian aircraft had flown more than 9,000 sorties over almost six months, killing more than 2,000 \"bandits\" and helping Syrian government forces regain control of 10,000 sq km (3,860 sq miles) of territory, including 400 population centres.</paragraph><paragraph>The claims have not yet been independently verified, but it is clear the air campaign turned the tide of the war in favour of Mr Assad, allowing Syrian government ground forces to regain territory around Latakia, in the southern province of Deraa and around the divided northern city of Aleppo.</paragraph><crosshead>What do critics say?</crosshead><paragraph>Moscow stressed that its air strikes only targeted \"terrorists\", but activists said Russian aircraft had mainly bombed Western-backed rebel groups and civilian areas.</paragraph><paragraph>In December, Amnesty International said Russian aircraft appeared to have directly attacked civilians by striking residential areas with no evident military target, which it warned might amount to war crimes. Russia's defence ministry dismissed the report as containing \"fake information\".</paragraph><paragraph>However, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported in early March that 1,733 civilians, including 429 children, had been killed in Russian air strikes, along with some 1,492 rebels and members of the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front, and 1,183 Islamic State (IS) militants.</paragraph></body>","shortFormBody":"<shortFormBody xmlns=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset\" xml:space=\"preserve\" xml:base=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/article/5dfcaa7a-732a-e041-8db7-4eab212eb300\"><paragraph>Russia will continue air strikes in Syria despite the withdrawal of most of its forces, a senior official has said.</paragraph><paragraph>Deputy Defence Minister Nikolay Pankov said it was too early to speak of defeating terrorism, after a campaign that has bolstered Syria's government.</paragraph><paragraph>Russian forces started leaving Syria on Tuesday after Monday's surprise announcement by President Vladimir Putin.

shore up the position of President Bashar al-Assad's government.</paragraph><paragraph>His gamble could still be a loser over the long term, but he currently has command of the table and over what happens next. </paragraph><paragraph>Mr Putin's combination of aggression and finesse is in sharp contrast to his American counterpart. Barack Obama has carefully guarded his chips, seeing little to be gained with the lousy cards in Syria.</paragraph><paragraph>While the United States is leading a limited military campaign against the Islamic State, Mr Obama has offered little more than the status quo ante when it comes to Mr Assad.</paragraph><image id=\"76020974\"/><crosshead>More on the Syria conflict</crosshead>  <list type=\"unordered\">    <listItem><!-- CPS Asset ID: 35812994 --><link><caption>Life and death in Syria</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-841ebc3a-1be9-493b-8800-2c04890e8fc9\"/></link></listItem>    <listItem><!-- CPS Asset ID: 35812995 --><link><caption>IS: The full story</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35695648\"/></link></listItem>    <listItem><!-- CPS Asset ID: 35812996 --><link><caption>Why has fighting gone on for five years?</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35806229\"/></link></listItem>    <listItem><!-- CPS Asset ID: 35812998 --><link><caption>Russia's 'peace mission' in Syria</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35721075\"/></link></listItem>    <listItem><!-- CPS Asset ID: 35812999 --><link><caption>Story of the conflict</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-26116868\"/></link></listItem>    <listItem><!-- CPS Asset ID: 35813000 --><link><caption>Tide turns Assad's way</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35562943\"/></link></listItem>  </list><image id=\"76020974\"/><paragraph>Mr Obama has called for Mr Assad to step down, but there has never been a real strategy behind that rhetoric. Mr Putin and Mr Obama are actually playing two interrelated but different games. Success in each game is the same - a functioning Syrian state that is not a safe haven for extremists. </paragraph><paragraph>Their paths are vastly different. One envisages the survival of the existing Syrian regime, with some symbolic accommodation with its political opposition. The other one involves an inclusive political process that results in genuine power-sharing. </paragraph><image id=\"88773706\"/><paragraph>Given the events of the past six months, Mr Putin is far closer to his goal than Mr Obama. Mr Obama insists that Syria does not represent a competition between the two leaders, but it is becoming increasingly hard to view it any other way.</paragraph><paragraph>While Mr Obama is fond of calling the United States the indispensable nation, it is President Putin who has repeatedly made himself indispensable in Syria.</paragraph><paragraph>First, after what he viewed as a fiasco in Libya, he made sure that the United Nations would not sanction a comparable intervention in Syria. There has been no international responsibility to protect the Syrian people from their dictator as there was in Libya. </paragraph><paragraph>Second, after Mr Obama threatened military action in response to Syria's crossing of his red line over the use of chemical weapons, Mr Putin imposed on Mr Assad to yield his chemical weapons stocks. However, this provided a de facto green light to attack the opposition through conventional means. </paragraph><paragraph>Finally, while Mr Obama hesitated at the use of military force, requesting congressional approval that would likely not have materialised, Mr Putin intervened decisively. </paragraph><image id=\"88773992\"/><paragraph>Where Mr Obama's contemplated use of military force would not have affected the military balance in the Syrian civil war, Mr Putin fundamentally changed at least one crucial fact on the ground. </paragraph><paragraph>Mr Obama's policy has been based until now on the presumption that Mr Assad's days are numbered. That may still be true but, thanks to Putin, the number is getting larger not smaller. </paragraph><paragraph>Mr Obama is right when he said that Syria cannot return to where it was before the civil war. He is also right when he says that the conflict will not end as long as Mr Assad remains in power. </paragraph><paragraph>But given that Mr Assad for the moment is not going anywhere, it is very likely that the political process that resumes this week in Syria is not going anywhere either. </paragraph><paragraph>As Mr Obama <!-- CPS Asset ID: 35809508 --><link><caption>suggested in a recent interview</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/\"/></link> with Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic, he does not see Mr Putin's intervention as a success, but rather as an over-extension. </paragraph><paragraph>Washington was content to play Huck Finn and let Moscow be Tom Sawyer and paint the fence. </paragraph><paragraph>The problem with the White House analogy is that in regional geo-politics, who actually paints the fence matters. Mr Obama over the past three years has been far too dismissive of the importance of the perceived decline in the credibility of American power.</paragraph><image id=\"88773710\"/><paragraph>Mr Obama suggests he wants to leave a \"clean barn\" for his successor. In fact, his successor will need to rebuild international trust and confidence in American leadership just as he did - albeit from a very different place. </paragraph><paragraph>In 2009, the United States was accused of doing too much, with dire consequences in Iraq. Today, the United States is accused of not doing enough, with dire consequences in Syria. </paragraph><paragraph>While Mr Obama has never believed that he needed to solve the tragedy in Syria - he has consistently viewed it as someone else's civil war - in all likelihood his successor will have to do more. </paragraph><paragraph>US efforts to date have degraded the Islamic State, but it is questionable whether it can be defeated through the existing limited levels of air power and special operations forces.</paragraph><paragraph>Mr Obama has been reluctant to do more, understandably fearing that greater involvement might exacerbate the extremist threat to the US and its allies. </paragraph><paragraph>While the current operational pause has had a greater effect on the ground than anticipated, the next president will likely inherit the Syrian civil war and find a solution to end it. </paragraph><paragraph>Its dangerous ripple effects cannot be ignored, even if the conflict itself does not represent an existential threat. </paragraph><paragraph>What is unclear is whether Mr Putin's gamble has made a solution to the Syrian conflict harder or easier to achieve.

It's at these conventions, to be held in July, that the Republican and Democratic nominees are chosen.</paragraph><paragraph>Although the rules vary slightly, the delegates at both party conventions vote on who gets the nomination and a simple majority carries the day. For the Democrats that means 2,386 out of 4,765 delegates. For Republicans the magic number is 1,237 out of a total of 2,472.</paragraph><include>  <title>Delegate tracker</title>  <path platform=\"highweb\" href=\"/news/special/2016/newsspec_13489/content/index.inc?responsive=true&amp;app-clickable=true&amp;app-image=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.files.bbci.co.uk%2Fvj%2Flive%2Fidt-images%2Fapp-image-delegate-tracker%2Fsuper_tuesday_app_promo_g4y8z.png\"/>  </include><paragraph>As of Monday businessman Donald Trump leads the Republican race with 460 delegates, followed by Texas Senator Ted Cruz (370), Florida Senator Marco Rubio (163) and Ohio Governor John Kasich (63).</paragraph><paragraph>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton leads the Democratic race with 774 delegates, while Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has 553.</paragraph><crosshead>The delegate calculation for the Democrats is more complicated than that, isn't it?</crosshead><paragraph>Sigh. Yes, it is.</paragraph><paragraph>The Democratic total excludes more than 700 \"superdelegates\" - party functionaries and officeholders who also have a vote in the party convention. Mrs Clinton currently has a significant lead among those who have announced their endorsement, garnering the support of 465 versus only 25 who are currently backing Mr Sanders.</paragraph><image id=\"88770107\"/><paragraph>Superdelegates are free to change their mind at any point before the convention, however, and it's unlikely they'd buck popular opinion if Mr Sanders is the choice of a majority of Democratic voters.</paragraph><paragraph>The Republicans have something similar to superdelegates at their convention but there are fewer of them and most are locked into supporting whoever their state voted for in its primary or caucus.</paragraph><crosshead>So what's so super about this Super Tuesday for Republicans?</crosshead><paragraph>For Republicans this latest slate of nomination contests is important not just because of the number of convention delegates up for grabs - 349 - but how they will be apportioned.</paragraph><paragraph>While the first Super Tuesday had a whopping 595 delegates at play, 15 March marks the first time states can hold \"winner-take-all\" primaries. The entire batch of delegates is awarded to the winner with even the narrowest plurality of the total state vote.</paragraph><image id=\"88745270\"/><paragraph><!-- CPS Asset ID: 35808635 --><link><caption>Will Florida be Marco Rubio's last stand?</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-35703304\"/></link></paragraph><paragraph>Florida (99 delegates) and Ohio (63) both use this system. Missouri (53) and Illinois (69) are winner-take-all at the congressional district level, so if one candidate performs well across the state that person could very well secure the entire bounty. Only North Carolina (69) will apportion its delegates proportionally based on the overall popular vote.</paragraph><paragraph>What all this means is that if Mr Trump, who leads in many of the state polls, does particularly well on Tuesday he could effectively lock up the nomination.</paragraph><paragraph>If, for instance, he wins both Ohio and Florida - a combined 162 delegates - he would only have to win about half of the remaining delegates over the next two months to assure a majority at the Republican convention.</paragraph><crosshead>What could stop Trump on Tuesday?</crosshead><paragraph>Mr Trump's biggest obstacle on Tuesday is that to win the two top prizes, Florida and Ohio, he will have to take down two rivals fighting on their home territory.</paragraph><paragraph>Mr Rubio, a distant third in the delegate count and coming off the multiple fourth-place finishes last week, is making a last stand in the state that sent him to the US Senate in 2010. He's spent almost the entire last two weeks campaigning across Florida in the hopes a win will jump-start his campaign.</paragraph><paragraph>According to recent polls, however, he continues to trail in the state and among the third of Florida Republicans who have already cast their ballots during the early voting period.</paragraph><!-- Embedded video --><video media-id=\"88671039\">    <caption>'Hungry Hungry' Elephants: What's a brokered convention and will Republicans have one?</caption>  </video><paragraph>Ohio looks like it will be a dogfight between Mr Trump and Mr Kasich, who as the sitting governor has a formidable campaign network in the state and remains popular among Republican voters there. Mr Kasich is a distant fourth in the total delegate count, so Ohio would provide him not only with his first outright win but also a much-needed numbers boost. </paragraph><paragraph>Mr Cruz beat Mr Trump in his home state of Texas on Super Tuesday and his second place in the delegate count seems secure regardless of this Tuesday's outcome. His goal is to try to keep pace with Mr Trump as best he can and prove he has nationwide appeal, even if he doesn't score any statewide wins.</paragraph><paragraph>The Texan is playing a long game at this point, hoping to outlast his anti-Trump rivals and then take down the New York real-estate mogul later, in a head-to-head showdown. </paragraph><paragraph>If Mr Trump loses in Florida or Ohio - or both - and if Mr Cruz or one of the other candidates does well in the other states, it could put a real dent in the New Yorker's chances of becoming the nominee without a brutal fight at the Republican convention.</paragraph><crosshead>Why is Tuesday so super for the Democrats?</crosshead><paragraph>The Democrats don't play the winner-take-all game, but that doesn't mean that this isn't a pivotal day for their presidential race as well.</paragraph><paragraph>Although Mrs Clinton has a solid delegate lead (with or without the superdelegates) Mr Sanders is riding a wave of momentum following a shocking upset in the Michigan primary last Tuesday. Polls leading up to the vote there showed him trailing by double digits, and he ended up with a narrow victory.</paragraph><paragraph>Now all eyes are on whether he can outperform polling once again, particularly in states that are near Michigan, like Ohio and Illinois, and have similar levels of white, pro-union, working-class voters who have been receptive to Mr Sanders's economic populism and anti-trade-deal rhetoric.</paragraph><image id=\"88770364\"/><paragraph>Mrs Clinton has consistently performed well in the south, so she could post big wins in Florida and North Carolina that would ameliorate close losses in the mid-west. She's still the odds-on favourite to win the nomination, but a poor performance on Tuesday will make the road much more difficult. </paragraph><paragraph>Across-the-board losses, if they were to happen, would throw the Democratic race into total turmoil. </paragraph><crosshead>Open primaries, closed primaries - why does it matter?</crosshead><paragraph>There's one more thing to take into consideration when looking at these coming primaries. Some of them are \"open\" to any voters, while others are \"closed\" to only registered party voters.</paragraph><paragraph>That makes a difference because, at least so far, Mr Trump and Mr Sanders have performed better in open primaries and caucuses, where their non-traditional voters can participate without the registration requirements and deadlines.</paragraph><paragraph>On Tuesday Florida is closed; Illinois and Missouri are open; North Carolina is open only to registered party members and independents; and Ohio requires voters to fill out party paperwork at the polls and affirm that they support the party's principles. </paragraph><paragraph>Sound complicated? Welcome to US-style democracy.</paragraph></body>","byline":{"name":"By Anthony Zurcher","persons":[{"name":"Anthony Zurcher","correspondentId":"anthonyzurcher","url":"/news/correspondents/anthonyzurcher","function":"North America reporter","thumbnail":"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/81364000/png/_81364544_anthonyzurcher_144x104.png","twitterName":"awzurcher","originCode":"MCS"}],"title":"North America reporter"},"media":{"images":{"body":{"88770362":{"height":549,"width":976,"originCode":"cpsprodpb","href":"http://c.files.bbci.co.uk/66C3/production/_88770362_gettyimages-515490266.jpg","altText":"Donald Trump points during a rally in Florida.","positionHint":"full-width","copyrightHolder":"Getty Images"},"88770364":{"height":549,"width":976,"originCode":"cpsprodpb","href":"http://c.files.bbci.co.uk/B4E3/production/_88770364_gettyimages-514549112.jpg","caption":"Bernie Sanders is trying to build on the momentum from his surprise win over Hillary Clinton in Michigan","altText":"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton wave to the audience after their debate in Miami.","positionHint":"full-width","copyrightHolder":"Getty Images"},"88770107":{"height":549,"width":976,"originCode":"cpsprodpb","href":"http://c.files.bbci.co.uk/111DB/production/_88770107_gettyimages-151225641.jpg","caption":"Delegates, most of whom are awarded on a state by state basis, formally nominate the candidate at the party convention in July","altText":"State signs on the floor of the hall at the Democratic convention in 2012","positionHint":"full-width","copyrightHolder":"Getty Images"},"88745270":{"height":549,"width":976,"originCode":"cpsprodpb","href":"http://c.files.bbci.co.uk/1C56/production/_88745270_rubio_florida.jpg","caption":"Florida Senator Marco Rubio must win his home state","altText":"Rubio in Florida","positionHint":"full-width","copyrightHolder":"Getty Images"}},"index":{"88772343":{"height":549,"width":976,"originCode":"cpsprodpb","href":"http://c.files.bbci.co.uk/8617/production/_88772343_88772342.jpg","altText":"Marco Rubio","copyrightHolder":"Reuters"}}},"videos":{"body":{"88671039":{"duration":"PT1M50S","available":true,"image":{"height":549,"width":976,"originCode":"cpsprodpb","href":"http://c.files.bbci.co.uk/1151A/production/_88683907_de45.jpg","altText":"Ted Cruz version of Hippo","copyrightHolder":"BBC"},"mimeType":"application/xml","href":"http://playlists.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2016-35770144A/playlist.sxml","externalId":"p03m2shr","caption":"'Hungry Hungry' Elephants: What's a brokered convention and will Republicans have one?","allowOffSiteEmbedding":false,"live":false,"entityType":"Version"}}}},"relatedGroups":[{"type":"related-hypers","items":[{"assetId":"33104822","assetUri":"/news/world-us-canada-33104822","firstCreated":"2015-06-11T23:29:05+00:00","language":"en-gb","lastUpdated":"2016-03-12T13:43:08+00:00","section":{"name":"US & Canada","id":"99127","uri":"/news/world/us_and_canada","urlIdentifier":"/news/world/us_and_canada"},"site":{"name":"BBC News","code":"news-v6","urlIdentifier":"/news","frontPageUri":"/news/front_page"},"title":"Republican road to the White House","type":"HYP","workerCallingCard":"app063.back.live.cwwtf.local-58"}]}],"options":{"allowRightHandSide":true,"allowRelatedStoriesBox":true,"includeComments":false,"isIgorSeoTagsEnabled":false,"hasNewsTracker":false,"allowAdvertising":true,"hasContentWarning":false,"allowDateStamp":true,"allowHeadline":true,"isKeyContent":false,"allowPrintingSharingLinks":true,"isBreakingNews":false,"suitableForSyndication":true},"language":"en-gb","id":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/e2d99efb-2b8f-5743-8b0f-21171ee41546","assetUri":"/news/election-us-2016-35805861","assetId":"35805861","headline":"US election 2016: What to expect from Super Tuesday -

They always make a mistake and the hacker just has to find one.\" </paragraph><crosshead>Government website threat</crosshead><paragraph>Rather than creating their own systems from scratch, there is a tendency to take a shortcut and use existing popular templates, which Mr Mawudor says can easily be breached. </paragraph><paragraph>He says he knows of several African governments that use these for their websites that can contain sensitive information including individuals' personal details, which can be used for identity theft.</paragraph><paragraph>According to the recent Kenyan cybersecurity report, most African-based businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, are unable to withstand cyber-attacks. </paragraph><paragraph>\"If there was the threat of a physical attack you would see a lot of fences and guards,\" says William Makatiani of Serianu Limited which was behind the report. </paragraph><paragraph>\"Unfortunately with cyber-attacks, very few people can detect them and you can go for up to a year without knowing you've been attacked.\"</paragraph><image id=\"86715361\"/><paragraph>At the Serianu offices in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, big screens show world maps with yellow spots appearing in different countries representing cyber-attacks happening in real time. </paragraph><paragraph>As these continue, Mr Makatiani suggests the main reason some companies are waking up to the threat is because they are losing money, but he says they are only disclosing these incidents discreetly. </paragraph><paragraph>The types of crimes are also becoming more sophisticated -

One of mine almost was thanks to Minecraft.</paragraph><paragraph>One of my boys wanted to install a mod for it and needed me to approve it.

When we found it, I was not sure we were getting it from the person who actually created it.</paragraph><paragraph>I was suspicious because the site was festooned with buttons that looked like they would start the download but instead led to dead ends populated by links to download accelerators and other utilities we did not want. Grubby ads blinked alongside.

And kept going. And going. Which was odd given it was only a few megabytes in size. My suspicions aroused, I killed the download over my son's protests. It was just as well. Running it through an online malware scanner revealed that though it was not actively malicious it would have installed adware and hijacked searches.</paragraph><paragraph>Definitely not the mod we wanted.</paragraph><crosshead>Big target</crosshead><paragraph>Soon afterwards, I found a warning about the page saying it was fake. That warning was circulated by <!-- CPS Asset ID: 35752730 --><link><caption>the Stop Mod Reposts campaign</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://stopmodreposts.org/\"/></link>. It is attempting to stop popular mods being hijacked by conmen, virus writers and cyber-thieves.  It maintains a long, long list of the scam pages offering re-packaged mods. It even makes an extension for web browsers that warns when you stray on to a dodgy site.</paragraph><paragraph>\"Minecraft is a huge target,\" said Chris Boyd, a security researcher at Malwarebytes and a veteran scam-spotter. He has seen fake sites offering the game for free, fake pages asking visitors to log in with their Minecraft name and password as well as a variety of other scams offering skins, capes and cheats.</paragraph><paragraph>But, he said, there was a long history of cyber-conmen going after children and the things they do online. He remembers seeing scams in 1999 that targeted the economy around Neopets - digital creatures popular with younger web users. </paragraph><image id=\"74982321\"/><crosshead>Staying safe online</crosshead><paragraph>Keep all software up-to-date and patched. Use anti-virus and anti-spyware software. And a firewall.</paragraph><paragraph>Give your children an account on a PC or laptop that restricts what they can install. </paragraph><paragraph>Use strong passwords (mix letters, numbers and symbols) and do not share them. Not even with friends.</paragraph><paragraph>Be wary of links offered in chat forums or in-game.</paragraph><paragraph>Talk to your children about what is appropriate behaviour. </paragraph><paragraph>Choose neutral user names. Use different login details on different sites.</paragraph><paragraph>Do not reveal personal information, even to those who are being friendly.</paragraph><paragraph>Be sceptical of flashy ads and links to games, cheats, and freebies that offer in-game currencies.</paragraph><paragraph>Check if there is a way to restrict who children play with online. Check online privacy settings to see with whom data is being shared.</paragraph><image id=\"74982321\"/><paragraph>Younger gamers are regularly targeted, said Mark James of security firm Eset and many inadvertently give away their age with the names they choose when they sign up to a site or service.</paragraph><paragraph>Scammers and conmen can lurk in forums offering advice and links to extras, cheats and advice pages that are actually laced with malware. </paragraph><paragraph>\"Often in-game chat channels play host to predators waiting for that click on a 'bad' link that infects a device,\" he said.</paragraph><paragraph>There is evidence that lurking on a gaming service pays off for the bad guys. Valve, which runs the massively popular Steam gaming service, revealed late last year that 77,000 accounts for the service are being hijacked each month. Control of those accounts will be lost via Steam's chat system or through booby-trapped links.</paragraph><image id=\"88633271\"/><paragraph>Mr James warned against befriending people on social media just to get \"freebies\" for games and said parents needed to educate children about safe browsing and gaming and what information was appropriate to share.</paragraph><paragraph>Without this, he said, children can be an easy target.</paragraph><paragraph>\"If they want that mod or add-on they will do almost anything to get it,\" he said. \"Unfortunately many young people do not have the perspective to see what long-term damage could be done if they are caught out.\"</paragraph><paragraph>Statistics from security firm Symantec suggest that younger people are getting hit regularly. A report it produced in early 2016 revealed that a quarter of parents have had a child or know someone with a child whose actions compromised the family's online security.</paragraph><paragraph>Jacqueline Beauchere, Microsoft's chief online safety officer, said scammers go to great lengths to catch children out.</paragraph><paragraph>\"Young people are easily enticed to click flashy advertisements, visit unofficial websites of popular celebrities, download so-called 'free' games, and tap 'Agree', 'OK', or 'I accept' to quickly get to where and what they want to online,\" she said. \"Many of these actions are just notorious pathways to viruses, spyware and other malicious software.\"</paragraph><paragraph>The scammers went after children, said Ms Beauchere, because of the cache of valuable loot that one mistake might lead them to.</paragraph><image id=\"88633275\"/><paragraph>\"Among criminals, personal and financial data about any and all individuals has become the sought-after 'currency' of the web,\" she said. Cyber-thieves targeted children only to get at this data, she said. </paragraph><paragraph>Mr Boyd from Malwarebtyes agreed. And, he said, what helped the scammers was the way children typically get online. </paragraph><paragraph>\"A lot of kids play via their parents tablets, laptops and desktops,\" he said. \"It's quite likely that parents will re-use login details on other accounts. And there's likely to be a payment method attached to it.\"</paragraph><paragraph>That is the data they are after, he said.</paragraph><paragraph>What makes this tougher to police, he said, is that children often know more than their parents about the technology.

players had been described in an internet chat log between two gamblers as their \"horses\".</paragraph><paragraph>The source told us using this term could mean the players were under the control of the gamblers.</paragraph><paragraph>These chat logs were among hundreds of files prosecutors sent to the TIU three months ago.</paragraph><paragraph>But Di Martino said TIU investigators had visited him and made it clear they were \"exclusively\" interested in the Italian players.</paragraph><paragraph>\"The international aspect seems more problematic than a situation involving a few Italian players,\" he said.</paragraph><paragraph>\"It would be possible to identify, possibly hit, many foreign players who definitely are part of this system.\"</paragraph><image

understand why there was no real initiative by the integrity unit to establish if there was something dirty behind this,\" he said. </paragraph><paragraph>Tennis has been accused of covering up evidence about widespread gambling on matches by players.</paragraph><paragraph>In January, tennis authorities launched an inquiry into corruption after the BBC and Buzzfeed News <!-- CPS Asset ID:

Documents seen by the BBC and Buzzfeed News suggest the gamblers approached two leading Italian players - but prosecutors say there is evidence they courted many others, including two who have been in the world's top 20. </paragraph><paragraph>Roberto di Martino sits back in his chair, his face creasing into a tight smile, pushing up his thin wire-rimmed glasses. I have just asked if I can look inside some of the dozens of manila folders of evidence about tennis match fixing piled around his vast office, beneath a fresco-covered ceiling. He shakes his head firmly, putting away the papers closest to me on his desk. </paragraph><paragraph>In May, he will present his evidence in court against two former Italian tennis players, Potito Starace and Daniele Bracciali, who are accused of conspiring to fix matches with Italian gamblers.</paragraph><image id=\"88767455\"/><paragraph>It has taken a long time to get the case this far. </paragraph><paragraph>The prosecutor from the northern Italian city of Cremona never set out to investigate tennis. In 2011, when police raided the home of Manlio Bruni, an accountant and gambler from Bologna, it was for involvement in a football corruption scam. He was placed under house arrest and his computers were seized.</paragraph><paragraph>But as investigators waded through the thousands of Skype instant messages on Bruni's computer they realised he was trying to corrupt tennis players.  Working with Buzzfeed News and the Italian newspaper, Il Sole 24 Ore, the BBC has obtained hundreds of pages of the evidence Di Martino chose not to reveal. </paragraph><!-- Embedded video --><video media-id=\"88768926\">    <caption>A former top-50 player exchanges Skype messages with a gambler offering him a match-fixing deal</caption>  </video><paragraph>In July 2007 Bruni began chatting on Skype to Daniele Bracciali, who had at one time been one of the world's top-50 players. They had been introduced by a mutual contact, who said Bracciali might be interested in fixing a match. </paragraph><paragraph>When Bruni decided to test him out, Bracciali was in the US, playing in the Newport tournament. He said it was \"extremely important to win the first set, and if possible, to go a break ahead in the second… would that be possible?... in this case I can give you much more\". </paragraph><paragraph>Bracciali refused, so Bruni tried again. \"OK, I could do 50 to begin with for tomorrow but it is absolutely necessary that you win the first set.\" By 50 he meant 50,000 euros (£39,000). Bracciali said he didn't know his opponent so it would be difficult to arrange to win the first set, and he told Bruni:  \"90% of me says no... but if I change my mind I will let you know.\"</paragraph><paragraph>Bruni finished by promising 60,000 euros (£46,000) if Bracciali changed his mind. He said he couldn't do it, repeating that \"it would be easier\" if he knew his opponent.</paragraph><paragraph>This was the start of a relationship that would last for four years until Bruni's arrest in 2011. During this period, prosecutors say, the gambling syndicate Bruni was a member of would try to corrupt countless other players in Italy and abroad. </paragraph><image id=\"88767423\"/><paragraph>This wasn't the first time Bracciali had been tapped up by match-fixers. Years earlier, his family and friends had gathered in the bar of his tennis club, just outside the ancient walls of the Tuscan town of Arezzo. They were there to watch Bracciali play in the French Open, the local boy made good. Just hours before the match he called his father to say he had been offered $50,000 (£35,000) to throw the match. Also at the club was Paola Cesaroni, mother of another local tennis star, Federico Luzzi. She recalls how Bracciali's father was furious. </paragraph><paragraph>He told his son, \"Don't do it, because tonight the whole town of Arezzo, all the supporters of your club are in front of a TV waiting for your match. So play, and win,\" Cesaroni says. This is exactly what Bracciali did. </paragraph><paragraph>Bracciali says he rebuffed Bruni's approaches too, and he denies any involvement in match-fixing. He told the police that he played along and faked interest - though one source close to the investigation says, \"You might fake for a month but you don't do it for four years.\" </paragraph><paragraph>Bruni later told prosecutors: \"I actually tried to corrupt him by offering him 50,000 euros if he won the first set and lost the other two during the game.\" Although Bracciali declined to fix this match, Bruni said that Bracciali \"declared himself available to contact the Italian tennis players he knew, to get them to do what I asked, altering in whole or in part the result of the matches\". </paragraph><paragraph>Bracciali first tried his sometime doubles partner, Potito Starace, who was then ranked number 31 in the world.  According to prosecutors, Starace agreed to work with Bracciali and Bruni from the end of 2007. Prosecutors claim Bracciali communicated with the gamblers while Starace carried out the fixes on court. </paragraph><image id=\"88767454\"/><paragraph>In December 2007 Bruni informed other gamblers in his syndicate: \"We bought Potito.\" Starace was promised between 30,000 and 50,000 euros (£23,000 to £39,000) for each match he agreed to fix. Bruni told prosecutors he even provided Sim cards so the players could speak to him without being detected. Prosecutors claim this went on until 2011. Potito Starace strenuously denies any contact with gamblers or involvement in match-fixing. </paragraph><paragraph>In the computers seized by the police, the gamblers discussed about 30 matches, including at Wimbledon and the French Open. But there are two matches in particular, according to chief Cremona prosecutor Roberto di Martino, \"for which we have very concrete indications that they have been manipulated\".</paragraph><image id=\"88733422\"/><paragraph><bold>Find out more</bold></paragraph><paragraph>Listen to Simon Cox's report for <bold>File on 4</bold> at 20:00 on Tuesday on BBC Radio 4, or <!-- CPS Asset ID: 35808159 --><link><caption>catch up later on the BBC iPlayer</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07378dc\"/></link></paragraph><image id=\"88733422\"/><paragraph>The first of these matches took place in May 2009. Manlio Bruni told police he had offered Starace 50,000 euros to lose against the lower-ranked German, Daniel Brands. The gamblers used several accounts to place bets that Starace would lose, but the betting company, Betfair, thought the betting looked suspect and refused to pay out their winnings when Starace lost. Bruni told the police the syndicate only made between 15,000 and 20,000 euros (£12,000 - £15,000) from the match but they decided to give this to Starace anyway and delivered it to him in cash at a tournament in Italy. There is no suggestion that Brands was aware that anything might be amiss.</paragraph><paragraph>Bruni checked with another gambler on Skype: \"Did he like the cash?\" The gambler replied he still hadn't seen it but added: \"Braccio [Bracciali] told me that he was very happy.\"</paragraph><image id=\"88766002\"/><paragraph>The second match took place in April 2011. Starace was taking on the Spaniard, Daniel Gimeno-Traver, in Barcelona and was offered 25,000 euros (£19,000) to lose, but double that if he won the first set and went on to lose the match. Starace withdrew and forfeited the match after winning the first set. He denies fixing this match or any other game. </paragraph><paragraph>A week before this match Starace had reached an ATP final in Casablanca. It was a big deal for him, a singles final. Bruni received a call about the game from a fellow gambler. He said Starace had taken 300,000 euros (£232,000) to lose. \"I remained astonished,\" Bruni told the police. \"Starace had always said that he would have been able to lose a first or second round but never a final.\"</paragraph><quoteBox><quote><quoteText>The international events seem more problematic than those situations in which, after all, only a few Italian players were involved</quoteText><quoteSource title=\"Cremona prosecutor\">Roberto di Martino</quoteSource></quote></quoteBox><paragraph>After receiving the call Bruni checked with Bracciali who said the idea Starace would throw a final was nonsense. In the end Starace did lose. Bruni told prosecutors: \"When I saw the result, the world fell apart.\"</paragraph><paragraph>Sources close to the investigation suspect that Starace was trying to work with a bigger, richer gambling syndicate. This part of the files was leaked to an Italian newspaper and Starace was furious when he read it. When he was interviewed by investigators in October 2014 he stated, \"I emphatically deny any arrangement to lose a match in a tournament.\"   </paragraph><paragraph>While the prosecutor was investigating Bruni's links with Bracciali and Starace, the Italian Tennis Federation used some of this evidence in 2015 to ban the two players for life for match-fixing. Starace's ban was later overturned and Bracciali's reduced to a year because the appeal panel said the evidence wasn't strong enough. The Cremona prosecutor had already reached this conclusion and decided to base his case on different matches. The players face another possible hit, though, as the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) - the sport's own anti-corruption body - has also been running an investigation into the players since 2014. So far no action has been against them internationally. </paragraph><paragraph>But arguably the TIU should be using the Italian investigation to look into other players linked to gamblers, not just Bracciali and Starace.</paragraph><paragraph>As the Cremona prosecutor Roberto Di Martino ploughed through the thousands of documents, he realised this was not solely an Italian problem.</paragraph><image id=\"88767458\"/><paragraph>He noticed the names of top foreign players being discussed by the gamblers and scams they were proposing. As a tennis fan their names leaped out at him. Some of these players featured in an earlier BBC/Buzzfeed News investigation which revealed the world <!-- CPS Asset ID: 35808158 --><link><caption>tennis authorities failed to act on repeated warnings</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35325473\"/></link> about 16 top-level players taking part in suspicious matches. </paragraph><paragraph>In one conversation in February 2011 a discussion takes place about two players who have been in the world's top 20, who the gamblers call their \"horses\".  One gambler says he has a conflict of interest as \"one of my horses is in the final\" and his \"other one is in the semi-final\".  He goes on to claim he is friends with one of the players and \"I have the pass as member of his staff\", before adding ominously, \"slowly my horses are coming to papa\".  A source close to the enquiry said referring to \"horses\" could refer to players who brought gamblers luck or alternatively that the players were under their control. </paragraph><paragraph>Roberto Di Martino refuses to name any of these non-Italian players, but says there is enough evidence in his files for investigators to question them, at the very least to find out if they were approached by gamblers.</paragraph><paragraph>He has limited ability to do this, so has handed all of his files to the TIU. But when they visited him three months ago they were only interested in the Italian players. He found this surprising and alarming. </paragraph><paragraph>\"The international events seem more problematic than those situations in which, after all, only a few Italian players were involved,\" he says. This was not a case of \"one single situation in which shadows were cast on important tennis players. The problem is that there are many situations, then it cannot be an accident, it cannot be a coincidence.\"</paragraph><paragraph>Nigel Willerton, director of integrity at the TIU said it \"acts on all evidence of corruption\". In January, following the BBC's revelations, an independent review panel was set up to look into match-fixing. Mr Willerton said: \"This wide-ranging remit will allow it to investigate all and any allegations of corrupt practice.\" </paragraph><paragraph><italic>Subscribe to the </italic><!-- CPS Asset ID:

At the age of 19, she joined the Irish order of Loreto where she was taught English. In 1929 she was sent to India.</paragraph><paragraph>Mother Teresa - she took the name from Therese of Lisieux - began teaching at a school in Darjeeling, a town in the Himalayan foothills. Then, in 1946, amid the communal strife that gripped British-ruled India at the time, she heard her \"call within\" to help the poor while living among them.</paragraph><paragraph>After 10 years helping the destitute in the slums of Kolkata, where 100,000 were homeless, she expanded by opening a hospice in the grounds of a Hindu temple in Kalighat, followed by a home for abandoned children and a refuge for lepers.</paragraph><image id=\"87280442\"/><crosshead>An ultra conservative</crosshead><paragraph>Her work spread throughout India, and her fame grew with it.

She told an Oxford conference in 1988 that she would never allow a child entrusted to her care to be adopted by a woman who had an abortion or used contraceptives. \"Such a woman cannot love,\" she said.</paragraph><paragraph>This put her at great odds with the feminist movement. Germaine Greer called her \"a religious imperialist\".

computer program has beaten a master Go player 3-0 in a best-of-five competition, in what is seen as a landmark moment for artificial intelligence.</paragraph><paragraph>Google's AlphaGo program was playing against Lee Se-dol in Seoul, in South Korea.</paragraph><paragraph>Mr Lee had been confident he would win before the competition started.</paragraph><paragraph>The Chinese board game is considered to be a much more complex challenge for a computer than chess.</paragraph><paragraph>\"AlphaGo played consistently from beginning to the end while Lee, as he is only human, showed some mental vulnerability,\" one of Lee's former coaches, Kwon Kap-Yong, told the AFP news agency.</paragraph><paragraph>Mr Lee is considered a champion Go player, having won numerous professional tournaments in a long, successful career.</paragraph><paragraph>Go is a game of two players who take turns putting black or white stones on a 19-by-19 grid. Players win by taking control of the most territory on the board, which they achieve by surrounding their opponent's pieces with their own.</paragraph><paragraph>In the first game of the series, AlphaGo triumphed by a very narrow margin - Mr Lee had led for most of the match, but AlphaGo managed to build up a strong lead in its closing stages. </paragraph><image id=\"88738434\"/><paragraph>After losing the second match to Deep Mind, Lee Se-dol said he was \"speechless\" adding that the AlphaGo machine played a \"nearly perfect game\".</paragraph><paragraph>The two experts who provided commentary for the YouTube stream of for the third game said that it had been a complicated match to follow.</paragraph><paragraph>They said that Lee Se-dol had brought his \"top game\" but that AlphaGo had won \"in great style\".</paragraph><paragraph>The AlphaGo system was developed by British computer company DeepMind which was bought by Google in 2014.</paragraph><paragraph>It has built up its expertise by studying older games and teasing out patterns of play. And, according to DeepMind chief executive Demis Hassabis, it has also spent a lot of time just playing the game. </paragraph><paragraph>\"It played itself, different versions of itself, millions and millions of times and each time got incrementally slightly better - it learns from its mistakes,\" he told the BBC before the matches started.</paragraph><paragraph>This virtuous circle of constant improvement meant the super computer went into the five-match series stronger than when it beat the European champion late last year.</paragraph><image id=\"74982321\"/><crosshead>What does this mean for artificial intelligence? Dr Noel Sharkey, AI expert</crosshead><paragraph>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has flirted with games since its beginnings, because only smart humans excel. Unlike the real world, a closed system of fixed rules suits computing. </paragraph><paragraph>Despite critical voices, Arthur Samuel's draughts playing program was an incredible achievement in 1959. Like AlpahGo it learned by playing itself repeatedly only many orders of magnitude slower.</paragraph><paragraph>Then the goal posts moved. The critics said chess was beyond computing's capability because it needed human intuition and creativity. But then when good amateur challengers had to eat their words in the 1970s, the goal post shifted again. </paragraph><paragraph>Critics claimed a horizon where computers might beat some professionals but certainly not grand masters. So when IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer beat world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, the world was astonished. But Deep Blue was not the human-like intelligence that the founding fathers of AI had hoped for. It won by brute force by searching through millions of moves in seconds. Humans have limited memory and need brilliant pattern perception and creative strategies to win.</paragraph><image id=\"88730430\"/><paragraph>So the critics turned to Go as the impossible. Even with today's vast computer memories and incredibly fast processors (which have doubled more than eight times since Deep Blue), the ancient game will not yield to brute force. The size of the search required for Go is larger than chess by more than the number of atoms in the universe. It is the holy grail of AI gaming.</paragraph><paragraph>When Facebook announced earlier this year that their program had beaten a strong Go amateur, jaws dropped in the AI community - and fell to the floor that same day when Google's Deep Mind genius team announced their AlphaGo beat the European champion 5-0. </paragraph><paragraph>To beat one of the world's top players, Deep Mind used a mixture of clever strategies to make the search much smaller. They trained their machine on 30 million expert moves to start with, and then the learning machine played against itself millions of times. It worked - the holy grail is in the bag and the goal posts can shift no further. </paragraph><paragraph>Does this mean AI is now smarter than us and will kill us mere humans? Certainly not. AlphaGo doesn't care if it wins or loses. It doesn't even care if it plays and it certainly couldn't make you a cup of tea after the game. Does it mean that AI will soon take your job? Possibly you should be more worried about that. </paragraph><image id=\"74982321\"/><crosshead>What is Go?</crosshead><!-- Embedded video --><video media-id=\"87961898\">    <caption>A brief guide to

surrounding their opponents pieces with their own.</paragraph><paragraph>The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves, compared with about 20 in chess - there are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe, according to DeepMind's team.</paragraph><paragraph>It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human

role=\"introduction\">Steps are being taken in Thailand to wean Buddhist monks off unhealthy food after a study suggested that almost half of them are overweight.</paragraph><paragraph>Jongjit Angkatavanich, a health and nutrition expert at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University, says 48% of monks are obese, <!-- CPS Asset ID: 35812620 --><link><caption>the Bangkok Post reports</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/897276/almost-half-monkhood-overweight\"/></link>. Her warning that \"Obesity in our monks is a ticking time bomb\" seems to have given the religious authorities cause for concern, with her figures showing that 42% have high cholesterol levels, 23% suffer from high blood pressure, and over 10% are diabetic. Dr Jongjit didn't say how many monks were involved in a study, but she's helping to roll out a national programme aimed at slimming down Thailand's holy men.</paragraph><paragraph>The government already covers medical fees for monks, who play a prominent part in Thailand's social and religious life, and spent more than 300m baht (£6m; $8.5m) on countering chronic obesity-related problems in 2012 alone, the paper says. Dr Jongjit singles out the sweet drinks and fatty foods that members of the public donate to the monks, and her Faculty of Allied Heath Sciences university is launching a campaign to promote leaner clerical living.</paragraph><paragraph>A monastic college and four temples in Bangkok are pioneering nutritional cooking programmes heavy on fibre, protein and calcium, and encouraging the clerics to take more physical exercise. Dr Jongjit says the monks involved have already lost an average of one kilogram (2.2lb) in weight over eight weeks, cut their waistlines by 1.4cm (half an inch), and seen drops in cholesterol levels. Some monks complain that they don't know how much weight they're putting on, which is why Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital has launched a special girdle that tightens around the waist as a gentle reminder. </paragraph><paragraph><bold>Next story: </bold><!-- CPS Asset ID: 35812344 --><link><caption>NZ police get bigger handcuffs for larger offenders</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-35811093\"/></link></paragraph><paragraph><italic>Use #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via </italic><!-- CPS Asset ID: 35812340 --><link><caption>Twitter</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NewsfromElsewhere&amp;src=typd\"/></link>.</paragraph></body>","media":{"images":{"body":{"88778424":{"height":549,"width":976,"originCode":"cpsprodpb","href":"http://c.files.bbci.co.uk/A5F7/production/_88778424_monks.jpg","caption":"Thai monks receiving food donations","altText":"Monks at Nakhon Ratchasima mark Magha Puja festival","positionHint":"full-width","copyrightHolder":"Getty Images"}},"index":{"88776298":{"height":549,"width":976,"originCode":"cpsprodpb","href":"http://c.files.bbci.co.uk/15CB3/production/_88776298_gettyimages-79885378.jpg","altText":"Thai monks receiving food offerings","copyrightHolder":"AFP"}}}},"relatedGroups":[{"type":"related-hypers","items":[{"assetId":"23064786","assetUri":"/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-23064786","firstCreated":"2013-06-26T10:28:45+00:00","language":"en-gb","lastUpdated":"2013-07-29T07:40:09+00:00","section":{"name":"News from Elsewhere","id":"102114","urlIdentifier":"/news/blogs/news_from_elsewhere"},"site":{"name":"BBC News","code":"news-v6","urlIdentifier":"/news","frontPageUri":"/news/front_page"},"title":"More News from Elsewhere","type":"HYP","workerCallingCard":"app064.back.live.cwwtf.local-57"}]}],"byline":{"name":"By News from Elsewhere...","persons":[{"name":"News from Elsewhere...","function":"...as found by BBC Monitoring","thumbnail":"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/68386000/jpg/_68386559_blog_paper_internet_radio.jpg","originCode":"MCS"}],"title":"...as found by BBC Monitoring"},"options":{"allowRightHandSide":true,"allowRelatedStoriesBox":true,"includeComments":false,"isIgorSeoTagsEnabled":false,"hasNewsTracker":false,"allowAdvertising":true,"hasContentWarning":false,"allowDateStamp":true,"allowHeadline":true,"isKeyContent":false,"allowPrintingSharingLinks":true,"isBreakingNews":false,"suitableForSyndication":true},"language":"en-gb","id":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/asset/c029c825-aa8c-8d45-b6d5-d9d6e9b6592c","assetUri":"/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-35812339","assetId":"35812339","headline":"Thailand's overweight monks are put on a diet","shortHeadline":"Thailand's overweight monks put on diet","section":{"name":"News from Elsewhere","id":"102114","urlIdentifier":"/news/blogs/news_from_elsewhere"},"site":{"name":"BBC News","code":"news-v6","urlIdentifier":"/news","frontPageUri":"/news/front_page"},"workerCallingCard":"app135.back.live.telhc.local-55","iStatsCounterName":"news.blogs.news_from_elsewhere.story.35812339.page"},"/news/world-us-canada-35811193":{"title":"BBC News -

They bought shares in rare manuscripts and letters to a value of nearly 1bn euros, before the company behind it was shut down by regulators. Now the victims of Aristophil want to know what is left of their investment.</paragraph><paragraph>Up until a few months ago you could visit a place called the Museum of Letters and Documents, on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in the heart of literary Paris.</paragraph><paragraph>Even this morning, Wikipedia English said the museum - with its stock of 130,000 rare manuscripts - was open for business. </paragraph><paragraph>It isn't. What was once the haunt of dreamy youth is now a branch of Bang and Olufsen. The documents are in a warehouse in Seine-Saint-Denis.</paragraph><paragraph>The closure followed the disgrace of a businessman and enthusiast, who over a decade turned the fusty world of French manuscripts and autographs on its head.</paragraph><image id=\"88761949\"/><paragraph>Gerard Lheritier was - for a time - a visionary. He saw in the world of rare letters and documents a market that was seriously undervalued.</paragraph><paragraph>As his lawyer Francis Triboulet puts it, \"Lheritier spotted before anyone else did that people adore old documents - anything that lets them come into physical contact with their heroes of the past.\"</paragraph><paragraph>But today his fortune has been confiscated, his company put into liquidation, while across the country thousands of angry investors are baying for his blood.</paragraph><paragraph>The son of a plumber from eastern France, Lheritier was a self-taught outsider in a field dominated by a handful of Paris dealers. About 15 years ago, he enlisted the help of one of these experts, and began buying.</paragraph><paragraph>One of his early acquisitions was a document called the Einstein-Musso - 54 pages of calculations on the theory of general relativity - which he bought for just over 500,000 euros.</paragraph><image id=\"88761952\"/><paragraph>Lheritier's next step was to become his business model. He divided the Einstein-Musso into 400 \"shares\", which he sold on to investors.  </paragraph><paragraph>The fact that the total value now amounted to 12m euros - 24 times the amount he had spent - was easily explicable: the market was growing, the investors were in early, and everyone wanted a piece of Einstein.</paragraph><paragraph>Over the years Gerard Lheritier developed his system to become king of the market. His presence at a sale set prices soaring.</paragraph><image id=\"88761948\"/><paragraph>His company Aristophil employed hundreds of sales staff across France, giving \"independent\" advice about the huge returns awaiting those willing to make the jump.</paragraph><paragraph>Aude Nehring's father was one of those who fell for the lure. Looking for an investment for his children,  he was approached by a broker and placed his 35,000 euros in part-shares in seven Aristophil documents.</paragraph><quoteBox><quote><quoteText>Gerard Lheritier was offering returns - 40% over five years - which he knew were unattainable</quoteText><quoteSource title=\"Lawyer\">Philippe Julien</quoteSource></quote></quoteBox><paragraph>He never saw the documents, but he was assured a return of 8% a year. In the contract, Aristophil reserved the right (but significantly not the obligation) to buy back the shares at the appreciated value.</paragraph><paragraph>Aude's father died two years ago, never realising that his investment was a dud.</paragraph><paragraph>\"It makes me so angry to think what Aristophil did,\" she says. \"My father was not a fool.  He was a businessman himself. But somehow they managed to persuade him.\"</paragraph><paragraph>Something about the cachet of owning historic  documents kept the punters coming.</paragraph><image id=\"88761954\"/><paragraph>And behind the hype there was some reality. Gradually Lheritier was amassing a huge collection of manuscripts - some of which were indeed very valuable: Dead Sea Scrolls, Mozart scores, a Marquis de Sade original.</paragraph><paragraph>France's best-known newsreader Patrick Poivre d'Arvor joined the roadshow, lending the scheme - in the eyes of the public - an adamantine kudos.</paragraph><paragraph>And there were the museums - first in Paris and a second in Brussels - pushing the notion that documents and letters from the past are intrinsically possessed of value.</paragraph><paragraph>But - as the French expression goes - the worm was in the fruit. In November 2014, financial regulators stepped in. Aristophil was defined as a Ponzi-style pyramid scheme, built on false advertising and illusionary market values. Lheritier was charged with fraud, and his vast collection put under lock and key.</paragraph><image id=\"88767460\"/><paragraph>Arguing his defence, lawyer Francis Triboulet told me that yes, things had taken a bad turn in 2013-14 - but it was wrong to say the Aristophil model was inherently fraudulent.</paragraph><paragraph>\"The fact is that the investors were acquiring actual items of value - the documents.

He is showing us how thousands of sacks loaded with contaminated earth are being collected and removed for disposal.</paragraph><image id=\"88764462\"/><paragraph>Mr Palomino denies it was a lack of maintenance that caused the 40-year-old pipeline to break, but he admits its unlikely to be the last such incident.</paragraph><paragraph>\"Yes, of course there will be accidents, that's inevitable,\" the site chief tells me as we survey the damaged steel pipeline.</paragraph><paragraph>\"But our biggest concern here is to restore the environment to how it was before and to minimise the risk to local communities,\" he adds.</paragraph><paragraph>This is the second major spill this year in the northern part of Peru's jungle region, not far from the border with Ecuador. </paragraph><crosshead>Risky clean-up</crosshead><paragraph>But, on top of the environmental impact, we came across something equally disturbing: evidence that children from poor, indigenous communities have been involved in the clean-up.</paragraph><image id=\"88764456\"/><paragraph>\"With just our bare hands, like this,\" 14-year-old Naith says and shows me how she and her two younger brothers scooped oil with their bare hands into buckets.</paragraph><paragraph>She says that they were paid about a dollar for each one by company officials. </paragraph><paragraph>Their father, Jaime, says he stopped them once he found out that they and most other children from the village had been gathering oil for the best part of a day.</paragraph><paragraph>\"They fell ill with fever and diarrhoea after being sent to the river,\" says the father of four. His middle son, seven-year-old Osman, is still in hospital. </paragraph><paragraph>Jaime shows me the boy's oil-stained clothes - not for him the protective white suits worn by the company employees.</paragraph><image id=\"88764460\"/><image id=\"88764458\"/><paragraph>In a statement PetroPeru said it explicitly prohibited the employment of children at the operations centre where it did hire local workers to help in the cleanup.</paragraph><paragraph>But the company said it would look into the allegations.</paragraph><crosshead>Long-lasting effects</crosshead><paragraph>Back out on the river, I watched a small army of workers hard at work removing oil-stained vegetation and debris.</paragraph><image id=\"88764454\"/><paragraph>The company insists that no expense and no amount of human effort will be spared to clean up this oil spill within a month. </paragraph><paragraph>But the effects will last much longer. </paragraph><paragraph>There is a state of emergency that means locals cannot use the water or fish in it for four months. </paragraph><paragraph>This is a waterway on which their very lives depend.</paragraph><paragraph>In the indigenous village of Nazareth, where many locals still live in traditional huts and eke out a subsistence living, one woman shows me her ruined, oil-stained fishing nets.</paragraph><crosshead>'Nothing but trouble'</crosshead><paragraph>\"It's a disaster for our community,\" Elemina tells me in her native Achuar language.  </paragraph><image id=\"88764750\"/><paragraph>With part of their land now contaminated, locals say oil has brought nothing but trouble to the region. </paragraph><paragraph>Environmental campaigners who work with Peru's indigenous communities say the combined effect of impunity for the oil companies and a lack of investment in decades-old infrastructure means that the underlying issues are rarely resolved. </paragraph><paragraph>The falling price for oil on global markets means that there is not much new oil exploration going on in the Amazon jungle these days, something that many people welcome. </paragraph><paragraph>The downside is that the smaller oil companies who still operate here do not have the resources or will to update and maintain their existing networks. </paragraph><paragraph>The Maranon and the mighty Amazon it feeds are big enough to cope with a spill of the size we saw in northern Peru but less certain is the future of the small communities which live alongside the riverbanks.</paragraph></body>","media":{"images":{"body":{"88762470":{"height":549,"width":976,"originCode":"cpsprodpb","href":"http://c.files.bbci.co.uk/1D02/production/_88762470_victorpalomino.jpg","caption":"Victor

The urgent and immense problems that India faces, make one realise that it has a narrow moment of time and opportunity,\" Prof Khilnani, author, most recently of Incarnations, which tells the story of the country through 50 remarkable lives over a period of 2,500 years and is the subject of a <!-- CPS Asset ID: 35803140 --><link><caption>new BBC Radio 4 series</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-32700958\"/></link>, tells me. </paragraph><paragraph>We are sitting in a hotel in Delhi, talking about his new book, India and the world. </paragraph><paragraph>\"Times are changing fast. Just 15 years ago, we were living in a much more open global economy which was more welcoming and positive. Now we are living in a much more protective climate, economies and polities are turning inwards, there is a rise of nationalistic politics in Europe and the US.\" </paragraph><crosshead>'Volatile world'</crosshead><paragraph>Back home, says Prof Khilnani, director of the India Institute at King's College in London, India is facing a formidable <!-- CPS Asset ID: 35800453 --><link><caption>youth bulge</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/sunday-review/the-world-has-a-problem-too-many-young-people.html?_r=0\"/></link> - every month, a million Indians turn 18, and every year the country needs to provide at least 12 million jobs - and a weakening of institutions, corruption, demagoguery and use of religion in politics.</paragraph><paragraph>\"We are living in a very volatile world where we have to take long-term decisions under short-term pressures.\" </paragraph><paragraph>So the choices India makes about preserving environment, inclusive growth, welfarism and federalism now will have \"enormous consequences\" and affect the world \"because India's footprint is so big globally\".</paragraph><paragraph>\"If you look at recent history, the real crunch happens in societies which have fared well for a bit, and then plateaued out. If that society has a lot of young people and if you don't have institutional capacity or will to deal with their demands, you are in for social upheaval,\" says Prof Khilnani.</paragraph><paragraph>\"So we are not living in a routine historical moment, we are living quite an exceptional moment where the choices we make will have a major bearing on our future.\"</paragraph><image id=\"88759841\"/><image id=\"88759926\"/><image id=\"88759685\"/><paragraph>But don't lose faith, he adds, for India has shown the capacity to handle pressures well. </paragraph><paragraph>Remember the pressures and urgency India faced at the time of Independence - the end of World War II, the bloody partition, birth of a nation, religious riots - and \"yet, somewhere, there was an ability [among the leaders] to stand back and take a long view\".</paragraph><paragraph>\"We have been there before. That's something we can draw from our history. Our bleak moments have often ended strengthening us.\"</paragraph><paragraph>As evidence he points to the darkest moment in India's history, the 22-month emergency rule in the mid-1970s, when the prime minister Indira Gandhi suspended civil liberties, jailed the opposition and muzzled the media. </paragraph><paragraph>\"Mrs Gandhi's countermand of democratic principles instilled something important in independent India's public life: it deepened a spirit of dissent, and of civic and legal activism,\" he writes in Incarnations.</paragraph><crosshead>'Not a new moment'</crosshead><paragraph>So is India living through a similar period of anxiety now, with concerns over a rising tide of Hindu nationalism, intolerance and challenges to free speech? Is a religious majoritarianism threatening the country's foundational commitment to diversity and pluralism?</paragraph><paragraph>\"I don't think it is a new moment. We have had periods like this in the last 150 years of our history. It is an ongoing struggle. When we are in the midst of it, it often looks as if it is a turning point. But that's very hard for us to judge, to have that historical perspective.\"</paragraph><paragraph>This does not mean, however, that people can be complacent, Prof Khilnani says.</paragraph><paragraph>\"We have to be engaged in preserving India's plurality with all our energies.

Some female students, each one with a book balanced on her head, are attempting to walk a few steps without the book falling off.  </paragraph><paragraph>One volume crashes to the ground, but most of the students make it to the other side of the space without mishap, to the approval of the smiling instructor.</paragraph><paragraph>But there's an unusual aspect to this class. It is not happening in Europe, home to many of the world's best-known finishing schools. Instead, it is taking place in Beijing.</paragraph><paragraph>Welcome to Institute Sarita, which it claims is China's first finishing school.</paragraph><paragraph>It is the brainchild of Sara Jane Ho. A native of Hong Kong, she went to boarding school and university in the USA.  After working in investment banking, and for a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in China, she spent some time studying at a Swiss finishing school. </paragraph><paragraph>Inspired by what she had learnt, on her return to China she decided to set up a school of her own.</paragraph><image id=\"88760452\"/><paragraph>\"Etiquette shouldn't be Chinese or French, it shouldn't be for the rich or for the poor, it should be for everybody,\" she says. </paragraph><paragraph>\"The spirit of etiquette, no matter where in the world, is the same - it's about respect and consideration for other people, and how to put other people at ease around you.\"</paragraph><crosshead>'Behave properly'</crosshead><paragraph>The school targets an older age group than its European counterparts. It offers two main courses - one for debutantes, and another, offering instruction in how to be a hostess, for married women.</paragraph><paragraph>One of the most important subjects it teaches is deportment. </paragraph><paragraph>\"It's about your character, and the feeling you give to others,\" explains the institute's president, Rebecca Li, who has also attended a Swiss finishing school. </paragraph><paragraph>\"You should make people feel you are confident - a person you can trust.\"</paragraph><paragraph>How you stand, how you sit, how you walk, how you enter a room, how you shake hands - all these things can have an impact on how you are perceived and how others around you feel, according to Ms Li, \"so you have to learn how to behave properly\".</paragraph><image id=\"88759882\"/><paragraph>Other lessons include the polite way to eat an orange (which involves using a knife and fork), table setting, and dinner party seating arrangements. </paragraph><paragraph>The vast majority of those who attend the school are women. Men occasionally take part in classes aimed at more mature students, such as lessons in dating etiquette, and managing personal relationships.</paragraph><paragraph>Ms Ho believes the fact that there is demand for courses offered by schools like hers is partly a result of the rapid changes happening in Chinese society.  </paragraph><paragraph>She says that women in particular can find it hard to adjust.</paragraph><paragraph>\"In the last century Mao said, 'women hold up half the sky'; he liberated women by letting them enter the workforce, and now in the career world, you do see women advancing,\" she explains.</paragraph><paragraph>\"But there's [also] 2,000 years of Confucian values which say 'the woman should be the noble protector of the home, and her place is the home, and to bear children.'\"</paragraph><image id=\"88759909\"/><paragraph>She also believes that globalisation is having a big impact, particularly on the wealthy.  </paragraph><paragraph>\"Elite Chinese are starting to send their children to boarding school, they're buying property abroad, they're emigrating abroad,\" she says. </paragraph><paragraph>\"They are learning very quickly, and they're becoming a lot more cosmopolitan, which is why etiquette, now more than ever, is very relevant.\"</paragraph><crosshead>'An investment'</crosshead><paragraph>Her students agree. Candice Li runs her own business, which conducts research into the luxury market. She often travels internationally, and says that she has become more confident in dealing with foreigners after attending the Institute's classes.</paragraph><paragraph>Studying at the school is far from cheap, with a 10-day debutante course costing around £8,500 (€11,000; $12,200).</paragraph><paragraph>But for another student, Chelsea Chen, \"how much you pay is not important, it's how much you can get from the course.\" </paragraph><paragraph>Ms Chen says she regards her attendance as an \"investment… for my family… and for everyone surrounding me\". She also hopes that, if in the future, she has children, she will be able to pass on what she has learnt to them. </paragraph><image id=\"88759913\"/><paragraph>Institute Sarita is no longer the only player in the market for etiquette training in China, and it is facing increasing competition. How does Ms Ho see the future of her enterprise?</paragraph><paragraph>\"In some ways it's kind of a silly little business,\" she says. \"We charge high prices, but the volume is very low… our classes are very small… and our costs are high… but I went to Harvard Business School, and I always think about how can I make this into something bigger?\"</paragraph><paragraph>Ms Ho says her role model is Martha Stewart, the American author, TV host and entrepreneur, who \"provided a guide for the suburban housewife\" on how to cook, decorate, and entertain.  </paragraph><paragraph>\"I want to provide the same to the modern day Chinese woman,\" she says. </paragraph><paragraph>\"I want to help her be the best mother that she can be, be the best wife that she can be, …make the home a place where she can invite loved ones and friends; and also [to learn] how to live, in this modern day world.\"</paragraph></body>","byline":{"name":"By Neil Koenig","persons":[{"name":"Neil Koenig","function":"Producer, Start-Up Stories","originCode":"MCS"}],"title":"Producer, Life of Luxury"},"media":{"images":{"body":{"88759706":{"height":549,"width":976,"originCode":"cpsprodpb","href":"http://c.files.bbci.co.uk/ED7B/production/_88759706_88759705.jpg","caption":"Deportment -

In 2009 Stephen Kim, a former government contractor, was sentenced to 13 months for giving classified material to a reporter.</paragraph><image id=\"88772487\"/><paragraph>But Petraeus is a high-profile figure. He has been credited with implementing the US military \"surge\" in Iraq that helped bring stability to the nation - at least temporarily. When President Barack Obama tapped him to head the CIA in 2011, his name was kicked around by some Republicans as a possible presidential candidate in 2012.</paragraph><paragraph>His celebrated background has led critics to suggest that there is a double-standard in cases involving the mishandling of classified information - one making it less likely that Mrs Clinton will face repercussions for her actions. </paragraph><paragraph>Mrs Clinton used a private server at her house while she was secretary of state, and some of her emails appeared to have contained classified information, though it's unclear whether that information was classified at the time it was sent. Revealing classified information is a crime.</paragraph><paragraph>Yet the offence is treated in different ways, depending upon the circumstances. They're also tough cases to prosecute.</paragraph><paragraph>Government lawyers have to prove an individual knew what he was doing when he revealed classified information, for example, or that she was unusually sloppy when handling the material.</paragraph><image id=\"88772489\"/><paragraph>After initially denying any culpability, Mrs Clinton has acknowledged that using a private server at her house was a mistake. </paragraph><paragraph>\"I should have used two email addresses, one for personal matters and one for my work at the State Department,\" she said on Facebook in September. \"I'm sorry about it, and I take full responsibility.\"</paragraph><paragraph>One of her former aides, Bryan Pagliano, set up the private server at her house. He has reportedly agreed to co-operate with authorities in the investigation. According to the Washington Post, he's been granted immunity.</paragraph><paragraph>Officials refused to talk to me on the record about the matter. \"I'll leave it to the leakers,\" Marc Raimondi, the justice department's national security spokesman says.</paragraph><paragraph>FBI agents may decide to question Mrs Clinton and more of her aides, both current and former, in the coming months.</paragraph><paragraph>The danger for Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign, even if she avoids criminal charges, is that it could play into the perception by some that the former secretary of state can't be trusted.</paragraph><paragraph>For conservatives hoping to defeat her in the general election and break the Democrats' eight-year hold on the Oval Office, that's good news. It also makes any discussion of the legal case fraught with political significance.</paragraph><paragraph>Every twist and turn in the case, such as revelations this week that one individual had agreed to co-operate with a federal investigation, is scrutinised.</paragraph><paragraph>Kurt Volker, a former US ambassador who's now executive director of the McCain Institute, says her actions are potentially worse than anything Petraeus did. </paragraph><paragraph>Though Petraeus willingly revealed classified information to his mistress, Mrs Clinton apparently sent email with classified information through a server without proper safeguards. As Volker sees things, the classified material became vulnerable to hackers.</paragraph><paragraph>\"Everybody and their uncle can potentially see that information,\" he says. \"That means Iranians, Chinese, whoever.\"</paragraph><paragraph>Volker believes she should be punished for her actions and that investigators are doing the right thing in their efforts to find out more about the case. </paragraph><paragraph>But he's sceptical about the outcome.</paragraph><paragraph>He believes that during an election year, with a Democratic administration in power, she's unlikely to be held accountable for what she did.</paragraph><image id=\"88772875\"/><paragraph>FBI agents will pursue it as a criminal matter, he says, but he believes that justice department officials will \"take into account the political context\" (and that Mrs Clinton is a Democratic candidate for the presidency.) </paragraph><paragraph>His suspicions about political bias in the White House reinforce a universal truth - campaign season is a time of passion, paranoia and fiery rhetoric.</paragraph><paragraph>Few in Washington think that formal charges will be brought against her, however. And if they were, it's hard to see how she'd be sent to prison for committing the same kind of crime for which Petraeus received probation.</paragraph><paragraph>If she is charged and avoids any serious penalty, then FBI agents, federal investigators - and plenty of her political adversaries - would have reason to be angry.</paragraph><paragraph>\"But as far as I can see no crimes have been committed,\" says Steven Aftergood, the director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists. \"So I don't see a place for that sort of frustration.\"</paragraph><paragraph>Like Volker, he sees the issue as political.</paragraph><paragraph>\"We've been bombarded with accusations before any indictment has been filed,\" Aftergood says. \"And for that reason it seems like a manufactured controversy.\"</paragraph><paragraph>And however you see the politics surrounding the case of Mrs Clinton's email, the controversy is bound to continue - at least until the election.</paragraph><paragraph><italic>Follow

Last year, the fires were so bad, that parts of Indonesia, together with cities across South East Asia, were blanketed in a thick toxic haze for weeks at a time. </paragraph><image id=\"85573481\"/><paragraph>Half a million people were hospitalised due to the haze, and it was estimated that in those five months about 1.7 billion tonnes of carbon - roughly equivalent to what Brazil produces in a year - had been released into the atmosphere.</paragraph><paragraph>Indonesia promised that it would do more to prevent the fires from returning in 2016.</paragraph><paragraph>But the fires are back already  - and now burning out of control. </paragraph><paragraph>A state of emergency has been declared in the western province of Riau, on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, and the army and police have been called in to try to fight the blazes. </paragraph><image id=\"88046074\"/><paragraph>So what more can the Indonesian government do? </paragraph><crosshead>What is causing the fires?</crosshead><paragraph>Indonesia's government owns the majority of the country's forest land. It provides grants or concessions to small scale farmers and to large companies.</paragraph><paragraph>In the 1980s burning forest areas to clear land for agriculture was sanctioned by the government, and today Indonesia has the highest rate of deforestation in the world.</paragraph><image id=\"86325052\"/><paragraph>For the last two decades, however, it has been against the law to clear more than two hectares of land each year, and using slash-and-burn methods for clearing is illegal.</paragraph><paragraph>But large companies have been accused of paying off small farmers for the use of their concession land - sometimes with just cigarettes and clothes - and then asking those small farmers to clear it for them. </paragraph><image id=\"75306515\"/><crosshead>What is 'slash-and-burn'?</crosshead>  <list type=\"unordered\">    <listItem>Farmers cut down forests and wild plants on their land, then set a fire to clear what remains</listItem>  </list>  <list type=\"unordered\">    <listItem>It is cheap and quick and some farmers believe they are ridding their land of diseases that could hurt their crops</listItem>  </list>  <list type=\"unordered\">    <listItem>Fires to clear land can spark wild fires and spread to carbon-rich peatlands</listItem>  </list>  <list type=\"unordered\">    <listItem>The peat fires release vast amounts of carbon emissions </listItem>  </list><image id=\"75306515\"/><crosshead>How has Indonesia tackled its fires in the past?</crosshead><paragraph>Policing the companies and small farmers responsible for lighting fires has been a huge challenge, and the forestry industry is often described as being riddled with corruption. </paragraph><paragraph>Last year President Joko Widodo told the BBC that he had <!-- CPS Asset ID: 35787445 --><link><caption>gone to great lengths</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34387979\"/></link> to tackle the fires, including the deployment of more than 10,000 police and soldiers and water-bombing planes.</paragraph><image id=\"85573986\"/><image id=\"85804719\"/><paragraph>And Mr Widodo said further development of peatlands would be banned, and that, where possible, his country's carbon-rich lands should be restored.</paragraph><paragraph>But he also told the BBC it would take <!-- CPS Asset ID: 35770555 --><link><caption>at least three years</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34387979\"/></link> before the world would see significant improvements as a result of on-going efforts to control the fires.</paragraph><paragraph>When the fires restarted this year, Henry Purnomo, a scientist who works at the Centre for International Forestry Resarch (Cifor), an organisation which works closely with the government, said Indonesia was employing some of its best fire-prevention efforts to date. He says while the fires are not yet very big \"we will need to move fast to suppress those fires burning now\".</paragraph><crosshead>What is the government doing now?</crosshead><paragraph>Cifor's Mr Purnomo said environmental workers were out in the field doing their best to rehabilitate about 600,000 hectares of precious peatlands  - with the aim of restoring some two million hectares in the coming years. </paragraph><paragraph>\"There is a lot of important work being done by the government as well as the private sector, including the giant companies and the wood plantation companies - they are trying to work together,\" he said. </paragraph><paragraph>\"And President Jokowi has said regional chiefs of police will be replaced if there are ongoing fires in their region.\"</paragraph><paragraph>In December last year, Indonesia announced that <!-- CPS Asset ID: 35770491 --><link><caption>more than 50 companies</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-35153050\"/></link> would be punished for their role in the fires  - and that further investigations were taking place.  </paragraph><paragraph>Just weeks later, however, <!-- CPS Asset ID: 35770492 --><link><caption>a $565m lawsuit</caption><url platform=\"highweb\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35203609\"/></link> against one plantation company was rejected due to lack of evidence. </paragraph><image id=\"85574726\"/><paragraph>However Mr Purnomo said Indonesia's government was continuing to investigate companies with questionable operations.</paragraph><paragraph>But there still are concerns that directives from central government may be ignored locally. </paragraph><paragraph>Meanwhile, Indonesia's anti-corruption commission said it was encouraging local government agencies in affected areas to come together on prevention efforts and report illegal behaviour to the authorities.</paragraph><paragraph>But Dian Patria, acting director of research and development at Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission, says the biggest challenge is that no-one wants to be held responsible for the decades-old problem.</paragraph><paragraph>\"There has been bad governance and bad management of the forests, based on our study of the last 12 years, and everyone says it is the fault of the previous minister, or previous governor,\" says Mr Patria. </paragraph><paragraph>\"There are a lot of stakeholders - local government, public and also the licensees - they must be less corrupt and work with us to solve it right now. The private sector especially has to be responsible.\" he added.</paragraph><paragraph>\"Many of the companies you must realise are based in Singapore and Malaysia too. They are not just Indonesian companies.\"</paragraph><crosshead>What more could be done?</crosshead><paragraph>Peter Holgrem, head of Cifor told the BBC that his teams are developing longer-term programmes to improve the situation. </paragraph><paragraph>But he said there were no quick or easy solutions.</paragraph><image id=\"85573477\"/><paragraph>\"It's not a matter of putting the fires out today - it's a matter of changing how land is being used, how agriculture is being practised and how the opportunities for people's livelihood are developing,\" he said. </paragraph><paragraph>Mr Holmgren, who is based in Indonesia, but works across 45 countries in fire prevention and research, also said it was not just about providing aid to Indonesia or to poor farmers. </paragraph><paragraph>\"It's obviously now primarily a matter of domestic policies and domestic regulations,\" he said.</paragraph><paragraph>\"But... a lot of the activities that are going on are because there are investments in land conversion and development - and obviously those investments engage international financial institutions in different ways.</paragraph><paragraph>\"So there are probably opportunities in looking at how the international finance system is regulating itself. And to look at the standards around which investments by large international institutions are being made.\"</paragraph><crosshead>Short and long-term targets </crosshead><image id=\"86492845\"/><paragraph>International forestry and fire fighting experts say one of the biggest problems facing Indonesia is its lack of fire-fighting know-how, particularly at a local level.</paragraph><paragraph>And fire prevention expert Tony Bartlett says wildfires, particularly forest fires, are an increasing problem as the impact of climate change increases.</paragraph><paragraph>Mr Bartlett who works for Australia's Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) says the international community can support Indonesia in tackling the blazes.</paragraph><image id=\"88693750\"/><paragraph>He argues it is essential to quickly detect and respond to forest fires \"with people that are well trained, properly managed and coordinated, and who can deal with different types of forest fires.\"</paragraph><paragraph>\"But it's very difficult when you have peatland on fire,\" he said. \"Forest fires look easy by comparison.\"</paragraph><image id=\"88693749\"/><paragraph>In the longer term, Cifor's head Mr Holmgren says one solution would be to take agriculture away from peatland completely. </paragraph><paragraph>But he argues the root of the problem is the income insecurity of poor farmers and that tackling that should be the priority.</paragraph><paragraph>\"The target is poverty,\" he says. </paragraph><paragraph>\"The target is economic growth and inclusive green growth. And the target is food security,\" he added.</paragraph><paragraph>\"If the issue is isolated to and portrayed as a climate change matter - and that's the story that everyone is hearing - then that is missing the target.\"</paragraph></body>","media":{"images":{"body":{"85571601":{"height":549,"width":976,"originCode":"cpsprodpb","href":"http://c.files.bbci.co.uk/2979/production/_85571601_0fad1598-f360-4e0f-8a52-94dbe2357fdc.jpg","caption":"Nasa

منشطات\".</paragraph><paragraph>وشعر نادال بانزعاج شديد لهذه التصريحات التي أدلت بها روزيلين باشيلو، التي كانت وزيرة للصحة والرياضة في فرنسا سابقا.</paragraph><paragraph>وقال نادال، الفائز بـ14 لقبا في بطولة غراند سلام، إنه سيقاضي أي شخص آخر سيزعم \"شيئا مشابها في المستقبل\".</paragraph><paragraph>وقال نادال إنه سئم من هذه المزاعم، ولم يعد مستعدا لأن يتركها تمر دون اتخاذ إجراء.</paragraph><paragraph>وأضاف: \"الوزير في الحكومة الفرنسية يجب أن يكون جادا. وهذا هو التوقيت (الذي يجب) التحرك ضدها، إننا سنقاضيها.\"</paragraph><paragraph>وتابع: \"هذه ستكون المرة الأخيرة (لهذه المزاعم) لأنني سأقاضيها. لقد سئمت من هذه الأشياء، لقد تجاهلت ذلك مرات قليلة في الماضي، ولن أسمح بها ثانية.\"</paragraph><paragraph>وشغلت باشيلو (69 عاما) منصب وزيرة الصحة والرياضة خلال الفترة من 2007 وحتى 2010 في ظل حكومة الرئيس السابق نيكولا ساركوزي.</paragraph><paragraph>وأدلت بهذه المزاعم بشأن نادال خلال حديثها عن فشل لاعبة التنس الروسية الشهيرة ماريا شارابوفا في اختبارات المنشطات.</paragraph><paragraph>وقالت الوزيرة الفرنسية السابقة: \"حينما ترى لاعب تنس يتوقف (عن اللعب) لأشهر، فإن ذلك يعود في الواقع إلى نتيجة إيجابية (لاختبار الكشف عن المنشطات)\"</paragraph><paragraph>وكان نادال تحدث بالفعل عن التكهنات المحيطة به.</paragraph>\n\t\n        <image id=\"d5e403\"/>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<paragraph>وعقب اعتراف شارابوفا الأسبوع الماضي بفشلها في اجتياز اختبارات المنشطات، علق لاعب التنس المصنف الأول عالميا سابقا بالقول: \"إنني رجل نظيف تماما.\"</paragraph><paragraph>وأضاف: \"لم يكن لدي مطلقا إغراء ارتكاب شيء خطأ.\"</paragraph><paragraph>ولم يفشل نادال مطلقا في اختبارات المنشطات، لكنه كان عرضة لتكهنات بتناوله المنشطات.</paragraph><paragraph>وكان يانيك نوح، الذي فاز سابقا ببطولة فرنسا المفتوحة، كتب مقالا في إحدى الصحف قال فيه إن نجاح اللاعب الأسباني نادال في ملاعب التنس يعود إلى تناوله المنشطات.</paragraph><paragraph>وبعد عام، عرض برنامج تلفزيوني فرنسي ساخر، شخصا بحجم نادال وهو يملأ خزان الوقود في سيارته من مثانته قبل أن توقفه شرطة المرور لتجاوز السرعة المقررة، في تلميح لتناوله المنشطات.</paragraph><paragraph>وعلى نفس المنوال، تساءل اللاعب البلجيكي السابق كريستوف روتشوس في عام 2013 كيف كان بإمكان نادال الفوز ببطولة فرنسا المفتوحة عام 2012، ثم تعرضه للإصابة بعدها بأسبوعين في ويمبلدن.</paragraph>\n\t</body>","media":{"images":{"body":{"d5e375":{"height":360,"width":640,"originCode":"amz","href":"http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/worldservice/live/assets/images/2016/03/14/160314130925_nadal_640x360_getty_nocredit.jpg","caption":"نادال

الفني الهولندي لويس فان غال لاعب الوسط مروان فلايني ودفع بالألماني شفانشتايغر بدلا منه.</paragraph><paragraph>وتحول اداء مانشستر بهذا التبديل ليتمكن مارشيال من إدراك التعادل في الدقيقة 83 ليحتكم

نهاية فعلية لموسمه بعدما صار بعيدا عن المنافسة على لقب بطولة الدوري الممتاز \"البريميير ليغ\" ولم يحصل على لقب كأس رباطة المحترفين ليصبح لقب بطولة كأس الاتحاد الانجليزي هو أخر لقب متاح للفريق خلال الموسم الجاري.</paragraph><paragraph>وردد مشجعو اليونايتد هتافات من المدرجات تطالب فان غال باستبدال لاعب الوسط البلجيكي مروان فلايني الذي قدم مردودا سيئا خلال المباراة لكن فان غال أصر على استمراره رغم تكرار خسارته للكرة في وسط الملعب بشكل متزايد.</paragraph><paragraph>وقبل 16 دقيقة فقط من نهاية الوقت الاصلي تم استبدال فلايني ليتطور اداء الفريق ويحقق

الوكالة التغييرات التي طرأت على قائمة المحظورات، لكنها لم تضغط على الرابط المؤدي إلى القائمة بعد تعديلها، ومن ثَمَ لم تتعرف على التعديلات.</paragraph><crosshead>تكهنات</crosshead><paragraph>وكانت هناك تكهنات بأن شارابوفا دعت إلى مؤتمر الاثنين الصحفي، الذي بث مباشرة على الهواء، لتعلن عن تركها لعبة التنس.</paragraph><paragraph>وقالت \"أعرف أن كثيرين منكم ظنوا أني سأتوقف اليوم عن اللعب، ولكني إن عزمت

في التنس بعد إصابتها \"لو كانت الأمر بالفعل صحيحا، فيجب - في رأيي - حرمانها من الألقاب التي حصلت عليها. فهذه حياة أناس آخرين\"</paragraph><paragraph>لكن مارتينا نافراتيلوفا، التي فازت بالبطولة 18 مرة

الأداء.</paragraph><paragraph>وظل العقار تحت المراقبة في قائمة (وادا) لنحو عام، ثم أضيف إلى قائمة العقارات المحظورة في 1 يناير/كانون الثاني.</paragraph><paragraph>ويصنع العقار في لاتفيا، وهو منتشر على

الأمريكية.</paragraph><paragraph>ويعتقد أن مئات من الرياضيين لا يزالون يستخدمونه، كما أن هناك حالات أخرى أكثر قد يكشف

عاما، إلى ليستر سيتي من نادي لو هافر الفرنسي في يناير/كانون الثاني 2014، في صفقة لم تزد قيمتها على 400 ألف جنيه استرليني. وأصبح محرز مصدرا للحماس هذا الموسم، إذ سجل 15 هدفا في الدوري الانجليزي الممتاز، من بينها هدف الفوز أمام فريق واتفورد يوم السبت الماصي.</paragraph><paragraph>إلا أن رحلة محرز حتى هذه النقطة كانت مليئة بالصعاب.</paragraph><paragraph>ولد محرز في ضاحية سارسيل في باريس، أحد الأحياء الأقل حظا في المدينة. وتوفي والده، أحمد، وهو ما زال في الخامسة عشر من عمره.</paragraph><paragraph>لكن إصرار محرز ومهارته أتاحت له الانتقال عبر أندية فرنسا، ومنها إلى قمة الدوري الانجليزي.</paragraph><crosshead>\"الأطفال يسألون عن محرز\"</crosshead><paragraph>اعتاد محرز الذهاب إلى مصفف الشعر نسيم في طفولته، وهو مصفف جزائري أيضا. وما زال نسيم هو نقطة اتصال محرز بماضيه.</paragraph><paragraph>ويقول نسيم: \"طوال الوقت، يطلب مني الأطفال، بسن الخامسة والسادسة، أن أقص له شعورهم مثل محرز. ويأتي الكثير من الزبائن إلي بسبب رياض. يأتون من بلجيكا ومن كل مكان. أعرف كل قصات شعره، وهو دائما ما يغيرها. ودائما ما يقلده الناس. كأنه كريستيانو رونالدو في سارسيل\".</paragraph>\n\t\n        <image id=\"d5e414\"/>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<paragraph>وتابع نسيم: \"غيّر (محرز) فريقه والبلد التي يلعب بها، لكنه لم يغير نظامه اليومي أبدا. ما زال يلتقي بأصدقائه، ودائما ما يزور سارسيل. رياض هو رياض. إنه فتى رائع. أنا سعيد جدا لأجله. كان أمرا خارقا عندما رأيته في الدوري الإنجليزي، يواجه فريق تشيلسي، ويتسبب في طرد مورينيو (مدرب الفريق آنذاك). يقشعر بدني حين يحرز رياض هدفا. أشعر بحاجة للبكاء عندما أراه يلعب\".</paragraph><crosshead>\"ملعب باسمه\"</crosshead><paragraph>والتحق محرز في بداياته بنادي إي إي إس سارسيل، عام 2004، وهو نادٍ يلعب في دوري باريس المحلي.</paragraph><paragraph>ويقول هايل مبيمبا، أحد زملاء محرز السابقين في الفريق إنه كان يلعب كرة القدم \"طوال اليوم كل يوم تقريبا. عندما ننتهي من التمرين مع الفريق، كان يتوجه إلى صالة الألعاب الرياضية في سارسيل. والرياضة، وخصوصا كرة القدم، هي الوسيلة للابتعاد عن الشارع والانجراف إلى طرق أخرى\".</paragraph><paragraph>وتابع: \"ربما خلال الأشهر القليلة القادمة قد نبني ملعبا جديدا ونسميه باسمه. أتمنى أن نفعل ذلك. رياض مثال يحتذى، ومصدر إلهام للشباب\".</paragraph>\n\t\n        <image id=\"d5e430\"/>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<crosshead>\"اتصل بأمه وهو يبكي\"</crosshead><paragraph>كيمبيه هي مدينة قديمة، في أكثر المناطق الممطرة في فرنسا، تقع على بعد 350 ميلا غرب المدينة، وتعرف بكاتدرائيها الأخاذة.</paragraph><paragraph>وفي عام 2009، حاول الفريق الاستفادة من الشاب البالغ من العمر 18 عاما آنذاك. لكنه لم يقدم له عقدا لعدم وجود ما يكفي من المال.</paragraph><paragraph>وبحسب كريستوف مارشاند، الصحفي الفرنسي الذي يغطي أخبار كيمبيه، فقد \"أجهش رياض بالبكاء وهو يتحدث إلى والدته عبر الهاتف. ورأي رئيس النادي الموقف، ووقع له عقدا بعد 24 ساعة. ربما ما كان حصل على العقد إن لم يكن له رد الفعل هذا. لم يكن رياض معروفا منذ ست سنوات، لكن الآن أصبحت له عبقريته\".</paragraph><paragraph>ولم يعلم أهل باريس الكثير عن محرز في ذلك الوقت، لكن هذه الدموع هي التي ساعدته في الوصول إلى الدوري الانجليزي الممتاز وكأس العالم بعد ثلاث سنوات ونصف في دوري الدرجة الثانية الفرنسي.</paragraph><crosshead>\"عشنا حياة الطلبة\"</crosshead><paragraph>كان كيمبيه في الفئة السابعة من الكرة الفرنسية عندما انضم إليه رياض، وذلك بعدما فاز الفريق بثلاثة تصعيدات في فترة قصيرة قبل انضمامه. وأمضى ستة أشهر في الفريق الرديف قبل التدرج داخل النادي. وعاش برفقة اللاعب ماثياس بوغبا، شقيق بول بوغبا الذي يلعب في نادي يوفينتوس الإيطالي، في شقة صغيرة في وسط المدينة. وانتقل من وإلى التمرين بصحبة صحفي محلي لأنه لم يستطع القيادة.</paragraph><paragraph>ويقول بوغبا عن محرز كرفيق في السكن: \"لم أتوافق معه في البداية لأنه لم يكن منظما، وأنا شديد النظام. اعتاد أن يأكل ويترك طبقه. وكان على أن أهذبه. وأصبح الأمر جيدا بعد شهرين أو ثلاثة. وكنا نتبع حميه غذائية شديدة السوء. كنا نأكل اللحم المحمر والبطاطس المقلية. وعشنا حياة الطلبة كشابين لا يستطيعان الطبخ\".</paragraph><paragraph>وتابع: \"اعتبرته أخي الأصغر. كنت أنصحه حتى ولو لم يستمع للنصيحة. ولا يمكن إيقافه إن أمسك الكرة. وكنت دائما ما أقول له إنه بحاجة لزيادة وزنه لأنه كان شديد النحافة. لا يوجد لاعب في نحافته حاليا، لكنه أصبح أكثر مهارة لذا، لا يحتاج لاستخدام جسمه\".</paragraph><paragraph>وعما إذا كان يمكن أن يصبح مش بول بوغبا، قال ماثياس: \"أعتقد أن بإمكانه ذلك. إذا استمر بهذه الطريقة، فسيصبح لاعبا كبيرا. لكنه بحاجة لاكتساب المزيد من الوزن\".</paragraph><crosshead>\"جوهرة في الوحل\"</crosshead><paragraph>ويقول رونان سالاون، مدرب محرز في كيمبيه: \"نظمنا يوما للتدريب، ولعبنا مباراة ودية مع عشرين لاعبا، واحتفظنا برياض فقط. أدركت حاجتنا إليه بعد عشرين دقيقة فقط. ورغم وجود بعض المشاكل في بنائه الجسماني، لكن لديه مهارات متميزة\".</paragraph><paragraph>وتابع: \"كان جوهرة في الوحل. لابد أن يستمر في النمو حتى وإن فاز ليستر بالدوري. الخطوة المنطقية هي أن يتقل إلى نادٍ أوروبي كبير ليتألق في الساحة الدولية\".</paragraph><paragraph>ويقول جو دورفال، أحد أعضاء مجلس الإدارة في كيمبيه، إن محرز وصل إلى النادي \"ومعه حقيبة بها ثلاثة أشياء فقط؛ فرشاة أسنان، ومعجون، وأحذية كرة القدم. كما أحضر قدمه اليسرى التي يكمن فيها سر مهارته، لكنها لم تكن في الحقيبة\".</paragraph>\n\t\n        <image id=\"d5e468\"/>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<crosshead>\"كتبت آنذاك أنه سيصبح عظيما\"</crosshead><paragraph>وأثناء وجود محرز في كيبيه، جذب عروضا من أندية باريس سان جيرمان، ومارسيليا. لكنه انتقل إلى نادي لو هافر على ساحل نورماندي، والمعروف بتبنيه للمواهب الشابة أمثال بول بوغبا، ودميتري باييت.</paragraph><paragraph>وكان رياض يبلغ 19 عاما عندما انضم إلى لو هافر عام 2010، وبقي فيه حتى انتقاله إلى ليستر عام 2014.</paragraph><paragraph>وكانت الأشهر التالية نقلة كبيرة لمحرز، إذ عمل المدرب إريك مومبايرتس على تطوير وعيه باللعبة ومهاراتها. وعادة ما استبدله المدرب بلاعب آخر عند خروجه على التعليمات.</paragraph><paragraph>ويقول يان سيمون، أحد أعضاء رابطة مشجعي لو هافر إن محرز كان مختلفا عن اللاعبين المعتادين في الفريق \"فاللاعبين المفضلين بالنسبة لي هم المجتهدون، ولاعبي خط الوسط الأقوياء. لكننا كنا نحب اللاعبين أمثال رياض أيضا.\"</paragraph><paragraph>وتابع: \"يفعل كلوديو رانييري، مدرب ليستر، الشيء ذاته. ويقال أن مومبارتس عمل كثيرا مع رياض لتطوير مهاراته\".</paragraph><paragraph>ويقال أن ليستر كان يسعى لضم ريان مينديز، الذي يلعب حاليا في نوتنغهام فورست. لكن المسؤولون عن اختيار اللاعبين عدلوا عن رأيهم بعدما رأوا محرز.</paragraph><paragraph>وقال فلوريان فلوك، عضو آخر برابطة مشجعي لو هافر: \"بالتأكيد كان مينديز هو اللاعب الأفضل. توقعنا أن يصل إلى مرتبة أعلى من محرز. مينديز كان لاعبا رائعا، لكنه مُني بإصابة بالغة. يقوم رياض دائما بنفس الحركة، وهي دحرجة الكرة بين عدد من اللاعبين على الظهير الأيمن، والمرور بينهم، ثم التصويب\".</paragraph><paragraph>وتابع: \"قد يفلح الأمر في انجلترا الآن، لكن ليس في دوري الدرجة الثانية في فرنسا. كتبت في مدونتي آنذاك أن رياض سيصبح لاعبا كبيرا، لكن الناس سخروا مني. إنه لاعب شديد المهارة، لكنه لم يستخدم مهارته جيدا. لديه موهبة وفقط. نحن سعداء من أجله وفخورون به\".</paragraph><paragraph>وأثمرت جهود محرز في النهاية، وفي يناير/كانون الثاني 2014، انتقل من نادي لو هافر إلى ليستر ستي في صفقة بقيمة 400 ألف جنيه استرليني، بقيادة نايجل بيرسون.</paragraph><paragraph>وثبت محرز أقدامه في الفريق الأساسي بعد فوز ليستر في البطولة وتصعيده.</paragraph><paragraph>وتمكن الجزائري النحيل من الوصول إلى الدوري الانجليزي الممتاز، وعاد ليستر إلى صدارة الدوري للمرة الأولى منذ عشر سنوات، وحقق رياض محرز حلمه.</paragraph>\n\t</body>","media":{"images":{"body":{"d5e392":{"height":360,"width":640,"originCode":"amz","href":"http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/worldservice/live/assets/images/2016/03/10/160310203711_mehrez_1_640x360__nocredit.jpg","positionHint":"full-width","copyrightHolder":"

role=\"introduction\"> نجح البديل ادينسون كافاني في تسجيل هدف الفوز لفريق باريس سان جيرمان الفرنسي في ذهاب دور الستة عشر من دوري أبطال أوروبا لكرة القدم ضد تشيلسي الإنجليزي.</paragraph><paragraph>وتقدم باريس سان جيرمان، صاحب الأرض، بهدف أحرزه السويدي زلاتان ابراهيموفيتش من ركلة حرة، قبل أن يسجل جون أوبي ميكل هدف التعادل لتشيلسي بتسديدة من على بعد ست ياردات مستغلا ارتباك الدفاع.</paragraph><paragraph>وكان دفاع تشيلسي، الذي تعرض لضغوط كبيرة خلال المباراة، في طريقه لضمان التعادل في المباراة قبل أن ينجح كافاني في تحويل تمريرة اللاعب الأرجنتيني أنخيل دي ماريا في مرمى تشيلسي.</paragraph><paragraph>وبالرغم من هزيمة تشيلسي، فإن هناك فرصة كبيرة أمامه في مباراة الإياب التي ستقام في ملعب \"ستامفورد بريدج\" في التاسع من مارس/ آذار المقبل.</paragraph><paragraph>ويرجع هذا إلى الهدف الذي سجله ميكل، بالإضافة إلى نجاح حارس المرمى تيبو كورتوا في إنقاذ تشيلسي من هدف محقق في الدقائق الأخيرة من المباراة كاد أن يحرزه المخضرم إبراهيموفيتش.</paragraph><paragraph>ووصف مراقبون هذه المباراة بالحاسمة لفريق تشيلسي بعد تعادله مع مانشستر سيتي يوم الأحد في منافسات كأس الاتحاد الإنجليزي.</paragraph><paragraph>وبعد أن فقد الفريق آماله في الحفاظ على لقب الدوري الإنجليزي الممتاز، فإن تشيلسي تحت قيادة غوس هيدينك سيعرف أوائل الأسبوع المقبل إذا كان بإمكانه تحقيق أي شيء في هذا الموسم الكروي المخيب للآمال.</paragraph><paragraph>ولكن مهما كانت النتيجة في لقاء الإياب مع مانشستر سيتي في بطولة كأس الاتحاد، فإن الفريق يأمل في تحقيق تقدم في هذه البطولة بعد أن قدم أداء جيدا في العاصمة الفرنسية أمام باريس سان جيرمان.</paragraph><paragraph>وهذه هي أول هزيمة يتلقاها الفريق منذ أن تولى هيدينك قيادة الفريق خلفا للبرتغالي جوزيه مورينيو الذي أقيل في نوفمبر/ تشرين الثاني الماضي، إذ نجح هيدينيك في لعب 12 مباراة دون أي هزيمة.</paragraph><paragraph>وفي الدور نفسه من دوري الأبطال، فاز فريق بنفيكا البرتغالي على ضيفه زينيت سان بطرسبورغ الروسي بهدف وحيد في الوقت المحتسب بدلا من الضائع.</paragraph><paragraph>ومنح المهاجم البرازيلي جوناس هدف الفوز لفريقه بتسديدة رأسية في الدقيقة 91 من المباراة.</paragraph><paragraph>وجاء الهدف بعد دقيقة من طرد دومينيكو كريشيتو مدافع بطرسبورغ إثر حصوله على البطاقة الصفراء الثانية في المباراة.</paragraph><paragraph>وكان بنفكيا الأفضل خلال الشوط الثاني أمام بطرسبورغ الذي لم يلعب أي مباراة منذ 10 أسابيع.</paragraph>\n\t</body>","media":{"images":{"body":{"d5e379":{"height":360,"width":640,"originCode":"amz","href":"http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/worldservice/live/assets/images/2016/02/16/160216233636_cavani__640x360_ap_nocredit.jpg","caption":"أنهى

تاريخ كرة القدم، إذ سجل 733 هدفا في 745 مباراة دولية خاضها في مسيرته الرياضية.</paragraph><paragraph>اشتهر اللاعب بمراوغاته المدهشة وانطلاقاته السريعة، وتوج بلقب أفضل لاعب في أوروبا عام 1965.</paragraph><paragraph>وفاز بالكأس الأوروبية مع ناديه بنفيكا البرتغالي في عام 1962، كان هداف الدوري البرتغالي 7 مرات خلال 15 عاما وتوفي في يناير/كانون الثاني.</paragraph><crosshead>لاعب كرة القدم الجزائري مصطفى زيتوني</crosshead><paragraph>ولد زيتوني في الجزائر إبان الاحتلال الفرنسي.</paragraph><paragraph>ولعب مع المنتخب الفرنسي أربع مرات، ووصفه لاعب ريال مدريد البارز ألفريدو دي ستيفانو بأنه أحد أفضل المدافعين في أوروبا.</paragraph><paragraph>لكن زيتوني ترك فرصة للمشاركة مع المنتخب الفرنسي في نهائيات كأس العالم 1958، وفضل المساعدة في تشكيل فريق كرة قدم لجبهة التحرير الوطني التي كانت تناضل من أجل الاستقلال عن فرنسا.</paragraph><paragraph>ولعب فريق جبهة التحرير الوطني 80 مباراة دولية قبل استقلال الجزائر عام 1962.</paragraph><paragraph>وتوفي زيتوني في يناير/كانون الثاني عن عمر ناهز 85 عاما.</paragraph><crosshead>اللاعب الكاميروني البير ايبوسي</crosshead><paragraph>كشف التشريح عن أن لاعب نادي شبيبة القبائل الجزائري، الكاميروني ألبرت إيبوسي، مات نتيجة الضرب المبرح الذي تعرض له في

لاتهامه بثلاث جرائم قتل في ولاية نيوجيرسي الأمريكية عام 1966.</paragraph><paragraph>وقد تسبب اتهامه الخطأ بالقتل في استنكار دولي شديد، وصُورت الأسباب العرقية المزمعة خلف هذا الاتهامات في أغنية \"الإعصار\" لبوب ديلان، وعدد من الكتب والأفلام</paragraph><paragraph>وخرجت حملة كبيرة لدعمه ضمت المغني الأمريكي بوب ديلان والملاكم محمد على كلاي، وطالبت بإطلاق سراحه.</paragraph><paragraph>وقال القاضي الذي أمر بإطلاق سراحه عام 1985 إن اتهام كارتر \"جاء بناء على أسباب عرقية وليست منطقية، وعلى التكتكم وليس التحقق\".</paragraph><paragraph>وتوفي الملاكم عن عمر ناهز 76 عاما في

اليابانية طوكيو على شرف تنظيم اولمبياد 2020 على حساب مدينة اسطنبول التركية وذلك في التصويت الذي جرى اليوم في مدينة بيونس ايرس عاصمة الارجنتين.</paragraph><paragraph>وكانت مدريد وهي المدينة الثالثة التي رشحت لتنظيم الاولمبياد قد خرجت من الدورة الاولى بعد جولة تمايز مع اسطنبول لنيلهما نفس عدد الاصوات، فيما جاءت العاصمة اليابانية في الطليعة.</paragraph><paragraph>ورغم التساؤلات الكثيرة التي طرحت حول نتائج وانعاكاسات كارثة مفاعل فوكوشيما النووي في آذار/مارس 2011 وعن مخاطر وقوع حادث نووي في المستقبل، الا ان اغلبية اعضاء اللجنة البالغ عددهم 97 عضوا فضلوا منح الاولمبياد لطوكيو وليس لاسطنبول التي لم يسبق لها او لأي مدينة تركية تنظيم الاولمبياد.</paragraph><paragraph>وكانت اللجنة الاولمبية الدولية قد افتتحت امس اعمال دورتها الخامسة والعشرين بعد المائة في العاصمة الارجنتينية.</paragraph><paragraph>واقيم احتفال موسيقي بهذه المناسبة على مسرح اورنات كولون وشارك في الحفل رئيس اللجنة الاولمبية الدولية جاك روغ الذي سيتم الاعلان خلال هذه الدورة عن اسم من سيخلفه في رئاسة اللجنة والذي القى كلمة بهذه المناسبة اعلن فيها اعتزازه بالفترة التي قضاها رئيسا للجنة الاولمبية الدولية خلال الاعوام الاثني عشرة الماضية ومؤكدا على المسؤولية التي يجب على اللجنة ان تستمر في القيام بها في رعاية الرياضيين وربط الرياضات بالمجتمعات.</paragraph><paragraph>ومن بين ابرز ما ستتضمنه اعمال اللجنة كذلك الاعلان عن اللائحة النهائية للرياضات التي ستشارك في اولمبياد 2020 ويشكل هذا تحديا كبيرا لرياضتين على وجه الخصوص وهما المصارعة والاسكواش.</paragraph><paragraph>وكانت لجنة من خبراء اللجنة الاولمبية الدولية قد اصدرت توصية قبل عدة اشهر باستبعاد المصارعة من اولمبياد 2020 ما اثار ردود فعل غاضبة على مستوى الاتحاد الدولي للعبة وفي عدد من الدول التي تمثل مراكز ثقل لهذه الرياضة ومنها ايران.</paragraph><paragraph>وفي حال اتخاذ اللجنة قرارا نهائيا باستبعاد هذه الرياضة ستكون اولمبياد 2020 هي الاولى منذ انطلاق الالعاب الاولمبية الحديثة التي تغيب عنها هذه الرياضة.</paragraph><paragraph>وفي هذا الصدد قال رئيس الاتحاد الدولي للمصارعة \"نيناد لالوفيتش\" أن الاتحاد أدخل العديد من التعديلات على قواعد التحكيم واحتساب النقاط الفنية مؤكدا على الخسارة الكبيرة التي سيسببها غياب هذه اللعبة عن عروس الرياضات.</paragraph><paragraph>وفي المقابل وبعد فشل الاتحاد الدولي للاسكواش في إدخال اللعبة إلى منافسات أولمبياد عام ألفين واثني عشر وألفين وست عشر, يسعى رئيس الاتحاد الدولي للعبة \"نارايانا راماتشاندران\" مجددا لضمها إلى منافسات أولمبياد ألفين وعشرين مؤكدا ان الرياضة ادخلت عليها تعديلات كثيرة تؤهلها لتكون ضمن الاولمبياد.</paragraph><paragraph>كما تتنافس رياضة البيسبول الامريكية من اجل ايجاد مكان لها على اللائحة النهائية لألعاب 2020

مرمى كوريا الجنوبية، في أكبر نتيجة لثعالب الصحراء في تاريخ كأس العالم.</paragraph><paragraph>وبعد الأداء القوي للخضر أمام المنتخب الألماني في دور الستة عشر بالبرازيل، انتقل براهيمي من نادي غرانادا الإسباني لنادي بورتو البرتغالي. وقدم براهيمي أداء قويا في الدوري الإسباني توجهه بهدف الفوز لفريقه في مرمى برشلونة في أبريل/نيسان الماضي.</paragraph><paragraph>وقاد براهيمي المنتخب الجزائري للتأهل للنسخة المقبلة من بطولة كأس الأمم الأفريقية الأربعاء الماضي بعد الفوز على منتخب مالاوي بثلاثية نظيفة، بعدما أصبح أول منتخب أفريقي يحقق العلامة الكاملة بالفوز في الأربع مباريات التي خاضها في التصفيات.</paragraph><paragraph>وقال براهيمي بعدما رُشح لجائزة بي بي سي: \"إنه لشرف لي الترشح لهذه الجائزة ويجعلني أشعر بالفخر، إذ إني لا أمثل النادي فقط وانما بلدي الجزائر وكل البلدان العربية والأفريقية\".</paragraph><paragraph>بدأ براهيمي (24 عاما) مسيرته الاحترافية في نادي رين الفرنسي، ثم انتقل للدوري الإسباني قبل أن يحط الرحال بنادي بورتو البرتغالي ويسعد جمهور ناديه بإحرازه ثلاثة أهداف في مرمى نادي باتي بوريسوف البيلاروسي في دوري أبطال أوروبا.</paragraph><paragraph>ولم يكتف براهيمي بإحراز الأهداف مع ناديه، لكن أهدافه ساهمت في تأهل المنتخب الجزائري لنهائيات كأس الأمم الأفريقية، حيث أحرز في مرمى كل من أثيوبيا ومالاوي.</paragraph>\n\t</body>","media":{"images":{"body":{"d5e377":{"height":360,"width":640,"originCode":"amz","href":"http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/worldservice/live/assets/images/2014/12/01/141201160057_algeria_640x360_getty.jpg","caption":"تميز

كما حقق الفريق الأسباني الفوز الثاني عشر له على التوالي في كل المسابقات الأوروبية والمحلية.</paragraph><paragraph>وأضاع لاعبو ريال مدريد فرصا عدة لزيادة النتيجة بسبب تألق حارس مرمى ليفربول سيمون مينيوليه الذي تصدى لهجمات عدة كانت أولها في الدقيقة الرابعة من تسديدة لجيمس رودريغيز.</paragraph><paragraph>وفي الدقيقة العاشرة، أخطأ قائد ليفربول مارتن سكرتل ووصلت الكرة إلى بنزيمة الذي هيأها بدوره إلى البرتغالي كريستيانو رونالدو لكن الحارس مينيوليه تصدى للكرة.</paragraph><paragraph>وجاءت الدقيقة 27 لتشهد هدف الفوز إثر تمريرة من لاعب الوسط ايسكو إلى زميله مارسيلو الظهير الأيسر الذي أرسل الكرة عرضية لبنزيمة فحولها داخل الشباك.</paragraph><paragraph>وشهد الشوط الثاني إهدار لاعبي ريال مدريد لعدة فرص بينما حاول ليفربول شن هجمات على استحياء كانت أبرزها في الدقيقة 56 من تسديدة البرتو مورينو ثم تسديدة لآدم لالانا في الدقيقة 58.</paragraph>\n\t</body>","media":{"images":{"body":{"d5e394":{"height":360,"width":640,"originCode":"amz","href":"http://a.files.bbci.co.uk/worldservice/live/assets/images/2014/11/04/141104233612_benzema_640x360_epa.jpg","caption":"بنزيمة
